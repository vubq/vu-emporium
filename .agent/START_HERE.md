## 🎯 First-Time Setup

### Step 1: Verify AI Can See This File

If you're reading this in an AI chat (Claude, Gemini, etc.), **you're good to go!** ✅

### Step 2: Activate the Agent System

Type this in your AI chat:

```
Read .agent/rules/GEMINI.md and activate all rules and skills
```

The AI will:
- ✅ Load GEMINI.md (master ruleset)
- ✅ Enable intelligent agent routing
- ✅ Activate Socratic Gate for better decisions
- ✅ Load 550+ specialized skills

## 🤖 How It Works

### **Automatic Skill Activation**

The AI will automatically:
1. Analyze your requests
2. Select the best specialist agent(s)
3. Ask clarifying questions when needed
4. Apply best practices from loaded skills

### **Example:**

```
You: "Create a login page"

AI: 🤖 Applying knowledge of @security-auditor + @frontend-specialist...

Before I start, let me ask:
1. OAuth or traditional email/password?
2. Need 2FA support?
3. Dark mode required?
```
