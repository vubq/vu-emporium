# 5. Final Verification

After all groups fixed:

- Run complete test suite: `make test`
- Verify no regressions
- Check test coverage remains intact

## Best Practices

- Fix one group at a time
- Run focused tests after each fix
- Use `git diff` to understand recent changes
- Look for patterns in failures
- Don't move to next group until current passes
- Keep changes minimal and focused

## Example Workflow

User: "The tests are failing after my refactor"

1. Run `make test` → 15 failures identified
2. Group errors:
   - 8 ImportErrors (module renamed)
   - 5 AttributeErrors (function signature changed)
   - 2 AssertionErrors (logic bugs)
3. Fix ImportErrors first → Run subset → Verify
4. Fix AttributeErrors → Run subset → Verify
5. Fix AssertionErrors → Run subset → Verify
6. Run full suite → All pass ✓
