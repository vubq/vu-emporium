# 3. Systematic Fixing Process

For each group (starting with highest impact):

1. **Identify root cause**

   - Read relevant code
   - Check recent changes with `git diff`
   - Understand the error pattern

2. **Implement fix**

   - Use Edit tool for code changes
   - Follow project conventions (see CLAUDE.md)
   - Make minimal, focused changes

3. **Verify fix**

   - Run subset of tests for this group
   - Use pytest markers or file patterns:
     ```bash
     uv run pytest tests/path/to/test_file.py -v
     uv run pytest -k "pattern" -v
     ```
   - Ensure group passes before moving on

4. **Move to next group**
