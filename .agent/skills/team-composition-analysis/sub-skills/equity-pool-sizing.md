# Equity Pool Sizing

**Option Pool by Round:**
- Pre-Seed: 10-15% reserved
- Seed: 10-15% top-up
- Series A: 10-15% top-up
- Series B+: 5-10% per round

**Pre-Funding Dilution:**
Investors often require option pool creation before investment, diluting founders.

**Example:**
```
Pre-money: $10M
Investors want 15% option pool post-money

Calculation:
Post-money: $15M ($10M + $5M investment)
Option pool: $2.25M (15% × $15M)
Founders diluted by pool creation before new money
```
