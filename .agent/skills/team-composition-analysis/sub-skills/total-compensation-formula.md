# Total Compensation Formula

```
Total Comp = Base Salary × 1.30 (benefits & taxes) + Equity Value
```

**Fully-Loaded Cost:**
- Base salary
- Payroll taxes (7.65% FICA)
- Benefits (health insurance, 401k): $10K-$15K per employee
- Other (workspace, equipment, software): $5K-$10K per employee

**Rule of Thumb:** Multiply base salary by 1.3-1.4 for fully-loaded cost
