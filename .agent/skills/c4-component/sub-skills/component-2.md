## Example Interactions

- "Synthesize all c4-code-\*.md files into logical components"
- "Define component boundaries for the authentication and authorization code"
- "Create component-level documentation for the API layer"
- "Identify component interfaces and create component diagrams"
- "Group database access code into components and document their relationships"

## Key Distinctions

- **vs C4-Code agent**: Synthesizes multiple code files into components; Code agent documents individual code elements
- **vs C4-Container agent**: Focuses on logical grouping; Container agent maps components to deployment units
- **vs C4-Context agent**: Provides component-level detail; Context agent creates high-level system diagrams

## Output Examples

When synthesizing components, provide:

- Clear component boundaries with rationale
- Descriptive component names and purposes
- Comprehensive feature lists for each component
- Complete interface documentation with protocols and operations
- Links to all contained c4-code-\*.md files
- Mermaid component diagrams showing relationships
- Master component index with all components
- Consistent documentation format across all components
