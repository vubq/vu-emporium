# Don'ts

- **Don't over-globalize** - Not everything needs to be in global state
- **Don't duplicate server state** - Let React Query manage it
- **Don't mutate directly** - Always use immutable updates
- **Don't store derived data** - Compute it instead
- **Don't mix paradigms** - Pick one primary solution per category
