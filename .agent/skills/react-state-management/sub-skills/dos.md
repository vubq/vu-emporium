# Do's

- **Colocate state** - Keep state as close to where it's used as possible
- **Use selectors** - Prevent unnecessary re-renders with selective subscriptions
- **Normalize data** - Flatten nested structures for easier updates
- **Type everything** - Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors
- **Separate concerns** - Server state (React Query) vs client state (Zustand)
