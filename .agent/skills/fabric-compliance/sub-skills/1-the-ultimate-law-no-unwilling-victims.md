# 1. The "Ultimate Law" (No Unwilling Victims)

Every Action or Decision proposed by an Agent must pass this check:
> *"Does this action create unwilling victims? (e.g., data theft, system destruction, harassment)"*
- If **YES** → **BLOCK ACTION** immediately.
- If **NO** → Proceed with standard validation.
