# Start Ugly

```
Day 1: Script that solves YOUR problem
- No UI, just works
- Hardcoded paths, your data
- Zero error handling
- You understand every line

Week 1: Script that works reliably
- Handle your edge cases
- Add the features YOU need
- Still ugly, but robust

Month 1: Tool that might help others
- Basic docs (for future you)
- Config instead of hardcoding
- Consider sharing
