# Event Store Design

Comprehensive guide to designing event stores for event-sourced applications.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to event store design
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Use this skill when

- Designing event sourcing infrastructure
- Choosing between event store technologies
- Implementing custom event stores
- Optimizing event storage and retrieval
- Setting up event store schemas
- Planning for event store scaling
