# ADR-0015: API Gateway Selection

In the context of **building a microservices architecture**,
facing **the need for centralized API management, authentication, and rate limiting**,
we decided for **Kong Gateway**
and against **AWS API Gateway and custom Nginx solution**,
to achieve **vendor independence, plugin extensibility, and team familiarity with Lua**,
accepting that **we need to manage Kong infrastructure ourselves**.
