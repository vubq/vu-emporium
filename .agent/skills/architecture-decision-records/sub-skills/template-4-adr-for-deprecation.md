# Template 4: ADR for Deprecation

# ADR-0020: Deprecate MongoDB in Favor of PostgreSQL

## Status

Accepted (Supersedes ADR-0003)

## Context

ADR-0003 (2021) chose MongoDB for user profile storage due to schema flexibility
needs. Since then:
- MongoDB's multi-document transactions remain problematic for our use case
- Our schema has stabilized and rarely changes
- We now have PostgreSQL expertise from other services
- Maintaining two databases increases operational burden

## Decision

Deprecate MongoDB and migrate user profiles to PostgreSQL.

## Migration Plan

1. **Phase 1** (Week 1-2): Create PostgreSQL schema, dual-write enabled
2. **Phase 2** (Week 3-4): Backfill historical data, validate consistency
3. **Phase 3** (Week 5): Switch reads to PostgreSQL, monitor
4. **Phase 4** (Week 6): Remove MongoDB writes, decommission

## Consequences
