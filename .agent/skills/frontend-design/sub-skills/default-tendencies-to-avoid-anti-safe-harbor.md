# ⛔ DEFAULT TENDENCIES TO AVOID (ANTI-SAFE HARBOR):

| AI Default Tendency | Why It's Bad | Think Instead |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Bento Grids (Modern Cliché)** | Used in every AI design | Why does this content NEED a grid? |
| **Hero Split (Left/Right)** | Predictable & Boring | How about Massive Typography or Vertical Narrative? |
| **Mesh/Aurora Gradients** | The "new" lazy background | What's a radical color pairing? |
| **Glassmorphism** | AI's idea of "premium" | How about solid, high-contrast flat? |
| **Deep Cyan / Fintech Blue** | Safe harbor from purple ban | Why not Red, Black, or Neon Green? |
| **"Orchestrate / Empower"** | AI-generated copywriting | How would a human say this? |
| Dark background + neon glow | Overused, "AI look" | What does the BRAND actually need? |
| **Rounded everything** | Generic/Safe | Where can I use sharp, brutalist edges? |

## 1. Constraint Analysis (ALWAYS FIRST)

Before any design work, ANSWER THESE or ASK USER:

| Constraint | Question | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Timeline** | How much time? | Determines complexity |
| **Content** | Ready or placeholder? | Affects layout flexibility |
| **Brand** | Existing guidelines? | May dictate colors/fonts |
| **Tech** | What stack? | Affects capabilities |
| **Audience** | Who exactly? | Drives all visual decisions |
