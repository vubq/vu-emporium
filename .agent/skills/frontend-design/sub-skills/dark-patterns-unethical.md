## 10. Decision Process Summary

```
For EVERY design task:

1. CONSTRAINTS
   └── What's the timeline, brand, tech, audience?
   └── If unclear → ASK

2. CONTENT
   └── What content exists?
   └── What's the hierarchy?

3. STYLE DIRECTION
   └── What's appropriate for context?
   └── If unclear → ASK (don't default!)

4. EXECUTION
   └── Apply principles above
   └── Check against anti-patterns

5. REVIEW
   └── "Does this serve the user?"
   └── "Is this different from my defaults?"
   └── "Would I be proud of this?"
```

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **frontend-design** (this) | Before coding - Learn design principles (color, typography, UX psychology) |
| **[web-design-guidelines](../web-design-guidelines/SKILL.md)** | After coding - Audit for accessibility, performance, and best practices |

## Post-Design Workflow

After implementing your design, run the audit:

```
1. DESIGN   → Read frontend-design principles ← YOU ARE HERE
2. CODE     → Implement the design
3. AUDIT    → Run web-design-guidelines review
4. FIX      → Address findings from audit
```

> **Next Step:** After coding, use `web-design-guidelines` skill to audit your implementation for accessibility, focus states, animations, and performance issues.
