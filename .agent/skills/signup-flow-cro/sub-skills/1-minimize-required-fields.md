# 1. Minimize Required Fields

Every field reduces conversion. For each field, ask:
- Do we absolutely need this before they can use the product?
- Can we collect this later through progressive profiling?
- Can we infer this from other data?

**Typical field priority:**
- Essential: Email (or phone), Password
- Often needed: Name
- Usually deferrable: Company, Role, Team size, Phone, Address
