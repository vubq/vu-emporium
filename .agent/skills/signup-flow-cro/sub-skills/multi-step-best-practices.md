# Multi-Step Best Practices

- Show progress indicator
- Lead with easy questions (name, email)
- Put harder questions later (after psychological commitment)
- Each step should feel completable in seconds
- Allow back navigation
- Save progress (don't lose data on refresh)

**Progressive commitment pattern:**
1. Email only (lowest barrier)
2. Password + name
3. Customization questions (optional)
