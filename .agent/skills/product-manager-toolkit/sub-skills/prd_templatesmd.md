Multiple PRD formats for different contexts:

1. **Standard PRD Template**
   - Comprehensive 11-section format
   - Best for major features
   - Includes technical specs

2. **One-Page PRD**
   - Concise format for quick alignment
   - Focus on problem/solution/metrics
   - Good for smaller features

3. **Agile Epic Template**
   - Sprint-based delivery
   - User story mapping
   - Acceptance criteria focus

4. **Feature Brief**
   - Lightweight exploration
   - Hypothesis-driven
   - Pre-PRD phase
