# Customer Discovery Process

1. **Conduct Interviews**
   - Use semi-structured format
   - Focus on problems, not solutions
   - Record with permission

2. **Analyze Insights**
   ```bash
   python scripts/customer_interview_analyzer.py transcript.txt
   ```
   Extracts:
   - Pain points with severity
   - Feature requests with priority
   - Jobs to be done
   - Sentiment analysis
   - Key themes and quotes

3. **Synthesize Findings**
   - Group similar pain points
   - Identify patterns across interviews
   - Map to opportunity areas

4. **Validate Solutions**
   - Create solution hypotheses
   - Test with prototypes
   - Measure actual vs expected behavior
