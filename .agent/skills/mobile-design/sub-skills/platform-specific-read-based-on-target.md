# Platform-Specific (Read Based on Target)

| Platform | File | Content | When to Read |
|----------|------|---------|--------------|
| **iOS** | [platform-ios.md](platform-ios.md) | Human Interface Guidelines, SF Pro, SwiftUI patterns | Building for iPhone/iPad |
| **Android** | [platform-android.md](platform-android.md) | Material Design 3, Roboto, Compose patterns | Building for Android |
| **Cross-Platform** | Both above | Platform divergence points | React Native / Flutter |

> 🔴 **If building for iOS → Read platform-ios.md FIRST!**
> 🔴 **If building for Android → Read platform-android.md FIRST!**
> 🔴 **If cross-platform → Read BOTH and apply conditional platform logic!**
