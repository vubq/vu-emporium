# Performance

- Cache API responses when data doesn't change frequently
- Use lazy loading in extensions
- Optimize images in themes using `img_url` filter
- Monitor GraphQL query costs via response headers

---

## Troubleshooting

**IF you see rate limit errors:**
→ Implement exponential backoff retry logic
→ Switch to bulk operations for large datasets
→ Monitor `X-Shopify-Shop-Api-Call-Limit` header

**IF authentication fails:**
→ Verify the access token is still valid
→ Check that all required scopes were granted
→ Ensure OAuth flow completed successfully

**IF extension is not appearing:**
→ Verify the extension target is correct
→ Check that extension is published via `shopify app deploy`
→ Confirm the app is installed on the test store

**IF webhook is not receiving events:**
→ Verify the webhook URL is publicly accessible
→ Check HMAC signature validation logic
→ Review webhook logs in Partner Dashboard

**IF GraphQL query fails:**
→ Validate query against schema (use GraphiQL explorer)
→ Check for deprecated fields in error message
→ Verify you have required access scopes
