# Copy Alternatives (If Relevant)

Provide 2–3 alternatives for:

* Headlines
* Subheadlines
* CTAs

Each with rationale tied to user intent.

## Page-Type Specific Guidance

*(Condensed but preserved; unchanged logic, cleaner framing)*

* Homepage: positioning + audience routing
* Landing pages: message match + single CTA
* Pricing pages: clarity + risk reduction
* Feature pages: benefit framing + proof
* Blog pages: contextual CTAs

## Experiment Guardrails

Do **not** recommend A/B testing when:

* Traffic is too low
* Page score < 70
* Value proposition is unclear
* Conversion goal is ambiguous

Fix fundamentals first.

## Questions to Ask (If Needed)

1. Current conversion rate and baseline?
2. Traffic sources and intent?
3. What happens after this page?
4. Existing data (heatmaps, recordings)?
5. Past experiments?
