# Ad Creative Testing

**Testing hierarchy:**
1. Concept/angle (biggest impact)
2. Hook/headline
3. Visual style
4. Body copy
5. CTA

**Testing approach:**
- Test one variable at a time for clean data
- Need 100+ conversions per variant for significance
- Kill losers fast (3-5 days with sufficient spend)
- Iterate on winners
