# Meta Audiences

**Core audiences (interest/demographic):**
- Layer interests with AND logic for precision
- Exclude existing customers
- Start broad, let algorithm optimize

**Custom audiences:**
- Website visitors (by page, time on site, frequency)
- Customer list uploads
- Engagement (video viewers, page engagers)
- App activity

**Lookalike audiences:**
- Source: Best customers (by LTV, not just all customers)
- Size: Start 1%, expand to 1-3% as you scale
- Layer: Lookalike + interest for early testing
