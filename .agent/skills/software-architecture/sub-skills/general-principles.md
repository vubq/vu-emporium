# General Principles

- **Early return pattern**: Always use early returns when possible, over nested conditions for better readability
- Avoid code duplication through creation of reusable functions and modules
- Decompose long (more than 80 lines of code) components and functions into multiple smaller components and functions. If they cannot be used anywhere else, keep it in the same file. But if file longer than 200 lines of code, it should be split into multiple files.
- Use arrow functions instead of function declarations when possible
