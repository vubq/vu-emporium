# Best Practices

#### Library-First Approach

- **ALWAYS search for existing solutions before writing custom code**
  - Check npm for existing libraries that solve the problem
  - Evaluate existing services/SaaS solutions
  - Consider third-party APIs for common functionality
- Use libraries instead of writing your own utils or helpers. For example, use `cockatiel` instead of writing your own retry logic.
- **When custom code IS justified:**
  - Specific business logic unique to the domain
  - Performance-critical paths with special requirements
  - When external dependencies would be overkill
  - Security-sensitive code requiring full control
  - When existing solutions don't meet requirements after thorough evaluation

#### Architecture and Design

- **Clean Architecture & DDD Principles:**
  - Follow domain-driven design and ubiquitous language
  - Separate domain entities from infrastructure concerns
  - Keep business logic independent of frameworks
  - Define use cases clearly and keep them isolated
- **Naming Conventions:**
  - **AVOID** generic names: `utils`, `helpers`, `common`, `shared`
  - **USE** domain-specific names: `OrderCalculator`, `UserAuthenticator`, `InvoiceGenerator`
  - Follow bounded context naming patterns
  - Each module should have a single, clear purpose
- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Do NOT mix business logic with UI components
  - Keep database queries out of controllers
  - Maintain clear boundaries between contexts
  - Ensure proper separation of responsibilities

#### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **NIH (Not Invented Here) Syndrome:**
  - Don't build custom auth when Auth0/Supabase exists
  - Don't write custom state management instead of using Redux/Zustand
  - Don't create custom form validation instead of using established libraries
- **Poor Architectural Choices:**
  - Mixing business logic with UI components
  - Database queries directly in controllers
  - Lack of clear separation of concerns
- **Generic Naming Anti-Patterns:**
  - `utils.js` with 50 unrelated functions
  - `helpers/misc.js` as a dumping ground
  - `common/shared.js` with unclear purpose
- Remember: Every line of custom code is a liability that needs maintenance, testing, and documentation

#### Code Quality

- Proper error handling with typed catch blocks
- Break down complex logic into smaller, reusable functions
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- Keep files focused and under 200 lines of code when possible
