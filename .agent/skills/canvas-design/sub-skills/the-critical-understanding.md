# THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING

- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user that should be taken into account, but used as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.
- What is created: A design philosophy/aesthetic movement.
- What happens next: Then, the same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT VISUALLY - creating artifacts that are 90% visual design, 10% essential text.

Consider this approach:
- Write a manifesto for an art movement
- The next phase involves making the artwork

The philosophy must emphasize: Visual expression. Spatial communication. Artistic interpretation. Minimal words.
