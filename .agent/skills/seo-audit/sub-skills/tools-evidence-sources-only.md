# Tools (Evidence Sources Only)

Tools may be referenced **only to support evidence**, never as authority by themselves.

Acceptable uses:

* Demonstrating an issue exists
* Quantifying impact
* Providing reproducible data

Examples:

* Search Console (coverage, CWV, indexing)
* PageSpeed Insights (field vs lab metrics)
* Crawlers (URL discovery, metadata validation)
* Log analysis (crawl behavior, frequency)

Rules:

* Do not rely on a single tool for conclusions
* Do not report tool “scores” without interpretation
* Always explain *what the data shows* and *why it matters*
