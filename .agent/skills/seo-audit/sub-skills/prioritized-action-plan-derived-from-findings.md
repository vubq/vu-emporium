# Prioritized Action Plan (Derived from Findings)

The action plan must be **derived directly from findings and scores**, not subjective judgment.

Group actions as follows:

1. **Critical Blockers**

   * Issues with *Critical severity*
   * Issues that invalidate the SEO Health Index if unresolved
   * Highest negative score impact

2. **High-Impact Improvements**

   * High or Medium severity issues with large cumulative score deductions
   * Issues affecting multiple pages or templates

3. **Quick Wins**

   * Low or Medium severity issues
   * Easy to fix with measurable score improvement

4. **Longer-Term Opportunities**

   * Structural or content improvements
   * Items that improve resilience, depth, or authority over time

For each action group:

* Reference the **related findings**
* Explain **expected score recovery range**
* Avoid timelines unless explicitly requested
