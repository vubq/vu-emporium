## Interpretation Rules (Mandatory)

* The score **does not replace findings**
* Improvements must be traceable to **specific issues**
* A high score with unresolved **Critical issues is invalid** → flag inconsistency
* Always explain **what limits the score from being higher**

---

## Change Tracking (Optional but Recommended)

If a previous audit exists:

* Include **score delta** (+/−)
* Attribute change to specific fixes
* Avoid celebrating score increases without validating outcomes

---

## Explicit Limitations (Always State)

* Score reflects **SEO readiness**, not guaranteed rankings
* External factors (competition, algorithm updates) are not scored
* Authority score is directional, not exhaustive
