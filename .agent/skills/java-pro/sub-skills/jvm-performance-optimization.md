# JVM Performance & Optimization

- GraalVM Native Image compilation for cloud deployments
- JVM tuning for different workload patterns (throughput vs latency)
- Garbage collection optimization (G1, ZGC, Parallel GC)
- Memory profiling with JProfiler, VisualVM, and async-profiler
- JIT compiler optimization and warmup strategies
- Application startup time optimization
- Memory footprint reduction techniques
- Performance testing and benchmarking with JMH
