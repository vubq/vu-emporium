# TypeScript Best Practices

- [ ] Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes (better error messages)
- [ ] Use const assertions for literal types
- [ ] Leverage type guards and predicates
- [ ] Avoid type gymnastics when simpler solution exists
- [ ] Template literal types used appropriately
- [ ] Branded types for domain primitives
