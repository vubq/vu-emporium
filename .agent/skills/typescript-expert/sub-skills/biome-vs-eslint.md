# Biome vs ESLint

**Use Biome when:**
- Speed is critical (often faster than traditional setups)
- Want single tool for lint + format
- TypeScript-first project
- Okay with 64 TS rules vs 100+ in typescript-eslint

**Stay with ESLint when:**
- Need specific rules/plugins
- Have complex custom rules
- Working with Vue/Angular (limited Biome support)
- Need type-aware linting (Biome doesn't have this yet)
