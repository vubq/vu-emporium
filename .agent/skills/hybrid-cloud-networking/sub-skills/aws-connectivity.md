# AWS Connectivity

#### 1. Site-to-Site VPN
- IPSec VPN over internet
- Up to 1.25 Gbps per tunnel
- Cost-effective for moderate bandwidth
- Higher latency, internet-dependent

```hcl
resource "aws_vpn_gateway" "main" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  tags = {
    Name = "main-vpn-gateway"
  }
}

resource "aws_customer_gateway" "main" {
  bgp_asn    = 65000
  ip_address = "203.0.113.1"
  type       = "ipsec.1"
}

resource "aws_vpn_connection" "main" {
  vpn_gateway_id      = aws_vpn_gateway.main.id
  customer_gateway_id = aws_customer_gateway.main.id
  type                = "ipsec.1"
  static_routes_only  = false
}
```

#### 2. AWS Direct Connect
- Dedicated network connection
- 1 Gbps to 100 Gbps
- Lower latency, consistent bandwidth
- More expensive, setup time required
