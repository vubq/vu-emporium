# Step 8: Create Three Scenarios

Build conservative, base, and optimistic projections:

**Conservative (P10):**
- New customers: -30% vs. base
- Churn: +20% vs. base
- Pricing: -15% vs. base
- CAC: +25% vs. base

**Base (P50):**
- Most likely assumptions
- Primary planning scenario

**Optimistic (P90):**
- New customers: +30% vs. base
- Churn: -20% vs. base
- Pricing: +15% vs. base
- CAC: -25% vs. base
