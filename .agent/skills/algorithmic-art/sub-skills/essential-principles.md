# ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES

- **ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY**: Creating a computational worldview to be expressed through code
- **PROCESS OVER PRODUCT**: Always emphasize that beauty emerges from the algorithm's execution - each run is unique
- **PARAMETRIC EXPRESSION**: Ideas communicate through mathematical relationships, forces, behaviors - not static composition
- **ARTISTIC FREEDOM**: The next Claude interprets the philosophy algorithmically - provide creative implementation room
- **PURE GENERATIVE ART**: This is about making LIVING ALGORITHMS, not static images with randomness
- **EXPERT CRAFTSMANSHIP**: Repeatedly emphasize the final algorithm must feel meticulously crafted, refined through countless iterations, the product of deep expertise by someone at the absolute top of their field in computational aesthetics

**The algorithmic philosophy should be 4-6 paragraphs long.** Fill it with poetic computational philosophy that brings together the intended vision. Avoid repeating the same points. Output this algorithmic philosophy as a .md file.

## DEDUCING THE CONCEPTUAL SEED

**CRITICAL STEP**: Before implementing the algorithm, identify the subtle conceptual thread from the original request.

**THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLE**:
The concept is a **subtle, niche reference embedded within the algorithm itself** - not always literal, always sophisticated. Someone familiar with the subject should feel it intuitively, while others simply experience a masterful generative composition. The algorithmic philosophy provides the computational language. The deduced concept provides the soul - the quiet conceptual DNA woven invisibly into parameters, behaviors, and emergence patterns.

This is **VERY IMPORTANT**: The reference must be so refined that it enhances the work's depth without announcing itself. Think like a jazz musician quoting another song through algorithmic harmony - only those who know will catch it, but everyone appreciates the generative beauty.
