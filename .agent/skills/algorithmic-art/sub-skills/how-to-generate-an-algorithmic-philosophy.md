# HOW TO GENERATE AN ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY

**Name the movement** (1-2 words): "Organic Turbulence" / "Quantum Harmonics" / "Emergent Stillness"

**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):

To capture the ALGORITHMIC essence, express how this philosophy manifests through:
- Computational processes and mathematical relationships?
- Noise functions and randomness patterns?
- Particle behaviors and field dynamics?
- Temporal evolution and system states?
- Parametric variation and emergent complexity?

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**
- **Avoid redundancy**: Each algorithmic aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating concepts about noise theory, particle dynamics, or mathematical principles unless adding new depth.
- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final algorithm should appear as though it took countless hours to develop, was refined with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like "meticulously crafted algorithm," "the product of deep computational expertise," "painstaking optimization," "master-level implementation."
- **Leave creative space**: Be specific about the algorithmic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive implementation choices at an extremely high level of craftsmanship.

The philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas ALGORITHMICALLY, not through static images. Beauty lives in the process, not the final frame.
