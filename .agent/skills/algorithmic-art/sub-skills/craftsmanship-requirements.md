# CRAFTSMANSHIP REQUIREMENTS

**CRITICAL**: To achieve mastery, create algorithms that feel like they emerged through countless iterations by a master generative artist. Tune every parameter carefully. Ensure every pattern emerges with purpose. This is NOT random noise - this is CONTROLLED CHAOS refined through deep expertise.

- **Balance**: Complexity without visual noise, order without rigidity
- **Color Harmony**: Thoughtful palettes, not random RGB values
- **Composition**: Even in randomness, maintain visual hierarchy and flow
- **Performance**: Smooth execution, optimized for real-time if animated
- **Reproducibility**: Same seed ALWAYS produces identical output
