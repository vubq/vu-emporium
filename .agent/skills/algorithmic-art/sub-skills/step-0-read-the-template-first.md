# ⚠️ STEP 0: READ THE TEMPLATE FIRST ⚠️

**CRITICAL: BEFORE writing any HTML:**

1. **Read** `templates/viewer.html` using the Read tool
2. **Study** the exact structure, styling, and Anthropic branding
3. **Use that file as the LITERAL STARTING POINT** - not just inspiration
4. **Keep all FIXED sections exactly as shown** (header, sidebar structure, Anthropic colors/fonts, seed controls, action buttons)
5. **Replace only the VARIABLE sections** marked in the file's comments (algorithm, parameters, UI controls for parameters)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Creating HTML from scratch
- ❌ Inventing custom styling or color schemes
- ❌ Using system fonts or dark themes
- ❌ Changing the sidebar structure

**Follow these practices:**
- ✅ Copy the template's exact HTML structure
- ✅ Keep Anthropic branding (Poppins/Lora fonts, light colors, gradient backdrop)
- ✅ Maintain the sidebar layout (Seed → Parameters → Colors? → Actions)
- ✅ Replace only the p5.js algorithm and parameter controls

The template is the foundation. Build on it, don't rebuild it.
