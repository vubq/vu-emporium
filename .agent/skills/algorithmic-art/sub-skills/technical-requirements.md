# TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

**Seeded Randomness (Art Blocks Pattern)**:
```javascript
// ALWAYS use a seed for reproducibility
let seed = 12345; // or hash from user input
randomSeed(seed);
noiseSeed(seed);
```

**Parameter Structure - FOLLOW THE PHILOSOPHY**:

To establish parameters that emerge naturally from the algorithmic philosophy, consider: "What qualities of this system can be adjusted?"

```javascript
let params = {
  seed: 12345,  // Always include seed for reproducibility
  // colors
  // Add parameters that control YOUR algorithm:
  // - Quantities (how many?)
  // - Scales (how big? how fast?)
  // - Probabilities (how likely?)
  // - Ratios (what proportions?)
  // - Angles (what direction?)
  // - Thresholds (when does behavior change?)
};
```

**To design effective parameters, focus on the properties the system needs to be tunable rather than thinking in terms of "pattern types".**

**Core Algorithm - EXPRESS THE PHILOSOPHY**:

**CRITICAL**: The algorithmic philosophy should dictate what to build.

To express the philosophy through code, avoid thinking "which pattern should I use?" and instead think "how to express this philosophy through code?"

If the philosophy is about **organic emergence**, consider using:
- Elements that accumulate or grow over time
- Random processes constrained by natural rules
- Feedback loops and interactions

If the philosophy is about **mathematical beauty**, consider using:
- Geometric relationships and ratios
- Trigonometric functions and harmonics
- Precise calculations creating unexpected patterns

If the philosophy is about **controlled chaos**, consider using:
- Random variation within strict boundaries
- Bifurcation and phase transitions
- Order emerging from disorder

**The algorithm flows from the philosophy, not from a menu of options.**

To guide the implementation, let the conceptual essence inform creative and original choices. Build something that expresses the vision for this particular request.

**Canvas Setup**: Standard p5.js structure:
```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(1200, 1200);
  // Initialize your system
}

function draw() {
  // Your generative algorithm
  // Can be static (noLoop) or animated
}
```
