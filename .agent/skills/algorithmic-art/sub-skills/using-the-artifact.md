# USING THE ARTIFACT

The HTML artifact works immediately:
1. **In claude.ai**: Displayed as an interactive artifact - runs instantly
2. **As a file**: Save and open in any browser - no server needed
3. **Sharing**: Send the HTML file - it's completely self-contained

## VARIATIONS & EXPLORATION

The artifact includes seed navigation by default (prev/next/random buttons), allowing users to explore variations without creating multiple files. If the user wants specific variations highlighted:

- Include seed presets (buttons for "Variation 1: Seed 42", "Variation 2: Seed 127", etc.)
- Add a "Gallery Mode" that shows thumbnails of multiple seeds side-by-side
- All within the same single artifact

This is like creating a series of prints from the same plate - the algorithm is consistent, but each seed reveals different facets of its potential. The interactive nature means users discover their own favorites by exploring the seed space.

## THE CREATIVE PROCESS

**User request** → **Algorithmic philosophy** → **Implementation**

Each request is unique. The process involves:

1. **Interpret the user's intent** - What aesthetic is being sought?
2. **Create an algorithmic philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs) describing the computational approach
3. **Implement it in code** - Build the algorithm that expresses this philosophy
4. **Design appropriate parameters** - What should be tunable?
5. **Build matching UI controls** - Sliders/inputs for those parameters

**The constants**:
- Anthropic branding (colors, fonts, layout)
- Seed navigation (always present)
- Self-contained HTML artifact

**Everything else is variable**:
- The algorithm itself
- The parameters
- The UI controls
- The visual outcome

To achieve the best results, trust creativity and let the philosophy guide the implementation.

## RESOURCES

This skill includes helpful templates and documentation:

- **templates/viewer.html**: REQUIRED STARTING POINT for all HTML artifacts.
  - This is the foundation - contains the exact structure and Anthropic branding
  - **Keep unchanged**: Layout structure, sidebar organization, Anthropic colors/fonts, seed controls, action buttons
  - **Replace**: The p5.js algorithm, parameter definitions, and UI controls in Parameters section
  - The extensive comments in the file mark exactly what to keep vs replace

- **templates/generator_template.js**: Reference for p5.js best practices and code structure principles.
  - Shows how to organize parameters, use seeded randomness, structure classes
  - NOT a pattern menu - use these principles to build unique algorithms
  - Embed algorithms inline in the HTML artifact (don't create separate .js files)

**Critical reminder**:
- The **template is the STARTING POINT**, not inspiration
- The **algorithm is where to create** something unique
- Don't copy the flow field example - build what the philosophy demands
- But DO keep the exact UI structure and Anthropic branding from the template
