# Phase 1: Internal Launch

Gather initial feedback and iron out major issues before going public.

**Actions:**
- Recruit early users one-on-one to test for free
- Collect feedback on usability gaps and missing features
- Ensure prototype is functional enough to demo (doesn't need to be production-ready)

**Goal:** Validate core functionality with friendly users.
