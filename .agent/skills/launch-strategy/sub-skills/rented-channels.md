# Rented Channels

Platforms that provide visibility but you don't control. Algorithms shift, rules change, pay-to-play increases.

**Examples:**
- Social media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram)
- App stores and marketplaces
- YouTube
- Reddit

**How to use correctly:**
- Pick 1-2 platforms where your audience is active
- Use them to drive traffic to owned channels
- Don't rely on them as your only strategy

**Example - Notion:**
Hacked virality through Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit where productivity enthusiasts were active. Encouraged community to share templates and workflows. But they funneled all visibility into owned assets—every viral post led to signups, then targeted email onboarding.

**Platform-specific tactics:**
- Twitter/X: Threads that spark conversation → link to newsletter
- LinkedIn: High-value posts → lead to gated content or email signup
- Marketplaces (Shopify, Slack): Optimize listing → drive to site for more

Rented channels give speed, not stability. Capture momentum by bringing users into your owned ecosystem.
