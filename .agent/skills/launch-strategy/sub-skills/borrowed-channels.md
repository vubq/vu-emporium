# Borrowed Channels

Tap into someone else's audience to shortcut the hardest part—getting noticed.

**Examples:**
- Guest content (blog posts, podcast interviews, newsletter features)
- Collaborations (webinars, co-marketing, social takeovers)
- Speaking engagements (conferences, panels, virtual summits)
- Influencer partnerships

**Be proactive, not passive:**
1. List industry leaders your audience follows
2. Pitch win-win collaborations
3. Use tools like SparkToro or Listen Notes to find audience overlap
4. Set up affiliate/referral incentives

**Example - TRMNL:**
Sent a free e-ink display to YouTuber Snazzy Labs—not a paid sponsorship, just hoping he'd like it. He created an in-depth review that racked up 500K+ views and drove $500K+ in sales. They also set up an affiliate program for ongoing promotion.

Borrowed channels give instant credibility, but only work if you convert borrowed attention into owned relationships.
