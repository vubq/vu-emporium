# Owned Channels

You own the channel (though not the audience). Direct access without algorithms or platform rules.

**Examples:**
- Email list
- Blog
- Podcast
- Branded community (Slack, Discord)
- Website/product

**Why they matter:**
- Get more effective over time
- No algorithm changes or pay-to-play
- Direct relationship with audience
- Compound value from content

**Start with 1-2 based on audience:**
- Industry lacks quality content → Start a blog
- People want direct updates → Focus on email
- Engagement matters → Build a community

**Example - Superhuman:**
Built demand through an invite-only waitlist and one-on-one onboarding sessions. Every new user got a 30-minute live demo. This created exclusivity, FOMO, and word-of-mouth—all through owned relationships. Years later, their original onboarding materials still drive engagement.
