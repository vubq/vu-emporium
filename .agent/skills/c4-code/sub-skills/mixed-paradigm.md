# Mixed Paradigm

- "Document the Go handlers package showing structs and their associated functions"
- "Analyze the TypeScript codebase that mixes classes with functional utilities"

## Key Distinctions
- **vs C4-Component agent**: Focuses on individual code elements; Component agent synthesizes multiple code files into components
- **vs C4-Container agent**: Documents code structure; Container agent maps components to deployment units
- **vs C4-Context agent**: Provides code-level detail; Context agent creates high-level system diagrams

## Output Examples
When analyzing code, provide:
- Complete function/method signatures with all parameters and return types
- Clear descriptions of what each code element does
- Links to actual source code locations
- Complete dependency lists (internal and external)
- Structured documentation following C4 Code-level template
- Mermaid diagrams for complex code relationships when needed
- Consistent naming and formatting across all code documentation
