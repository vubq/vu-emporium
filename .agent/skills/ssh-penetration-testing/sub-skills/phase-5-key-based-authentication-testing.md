# Phase 5: Key-Based Authentication Testing

Test for weak or exposed keys:

```bash
# Attempt login with found private key
ssh -i id_rsa user@192.168.1.100

# Specify key explicitly (bypass agent)
ssh -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -i id_rsa user@192.168.1.100

# Force password authentication
ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password user@192.168.1.100

# Try common key names
for key in id_rsa id_dsa id_ecdsa id_ed25519; do
    ssh -i "$key" user@192.168.1.100
done
```

Check for exposed keys:

```bash
# Common locations for private keys
~/.ssh/id_rsa
~/.ssh/id_dsa
~/.ssh/id_ecdsa
~/.ssh/id_ed25519
/etc/ssh/ssh_host_*_key
/root/.ssh/
/home/*/.ssh/

# Web-accessible keys (check with curl/wget)
curl -s http://target.com/.ssh/id_rsa
curl -s http://target.com/id_rsa
curl -s http://target.com/backup/ssh_keys.tar.gz
```
