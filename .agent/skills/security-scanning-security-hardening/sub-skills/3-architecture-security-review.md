# 3. Architecture Security Review

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="backend-api-security::backend-architect"
- Prompt: "Review architecture for security weaknesses in: $ARGUMENTS. Evaluate service boundaries, data flow security, authentication/authorization architecture, encryption implementation, network segmentation. Design zero-trust architecture patterns. Reference threat model and vulnerability findings."
- Output: Security architecture assessment, zero-trust design recommendations, service mesh security requirements, data classification matrix
- Context: Incorporates threat model to address architectural vulnerabilities
