# 1. Initial Vulnerability Scanning

- Use Task tool with subagent_type="security-auditor"
- Prompt: "Perform comprehensive security assessment on: $ARGUMENTS. Execute SAST analysis with Semgrep/SonarQube, DAST scanning with OWASP ZAP, dependency audit with Snyk/Trivy, secrets detection with GitLeaks/TruffleHog. Generate SBOM for supply chain analysis. Identify OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, CWE weaknesses, and CVE exposures."
- Output: Detailed vulnerability report with CVSS scores, exploitability analysis, attack surface mapping, secrets exposure report, SBOM inventory
- Context: Initial baseline for all remediation efforts
