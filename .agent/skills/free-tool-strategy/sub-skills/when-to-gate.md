# When to Gate

**Fully gated (email required to use):**
- High-value, unique tools
- Personalized reports
- Risk: Lower usage

**Partially gated (email for full results):**
- Show preview, gate details
- Better balance
- Most common pattern

**Ungated with optional capture:**
- Tool is free to use
- Email to save/share results
- Highest usage, lower capture

**Ungated entirely:**
- Pure SEO/brand play
- No direct leads
- Maximum reach
