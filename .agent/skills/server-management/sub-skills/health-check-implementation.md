## 6. Security Principles

| Area | Principle |
|------|-----------|
| **Access** | SSH keys only, no passwords |
| **Firewall** | Only needed ports open |
| **Updates** | Regular security patches |
| **Secrets** | Environment vars, not files |
| **Audit** | Log access and changes |

---

## 7. Troubleshooting Priority

When something's wrong:

1. **Check if running** (process status)
2. **Check logs** (error messages)
3. **Check resources** (disk, memory, CPU)
4. **Check network** (ports, DNS)
5. **Check dependencies** (database, APIs)

## 8. Anti-Patterns

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Run as root | Use non-root user |
| Ignore logs | Set up log rotation |
| Skip monitoring | Monitor from day one |
| Manual restarts | Auto-restart config |
| No backups | Regular backup schedule |
