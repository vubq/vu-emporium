## Working with Copy Sweeps

When editing collaboratively:

1. **Run a sweep and present findings** - Show what you found, why it's an issue
2. **Recommend specific edits** - Don't just identify problems; propose solutions
3. **Request the updated copy** - Let the author make final decisions
4. **Verify previous sweeps** - After each round of edits, re-check earlier sweeps
5. **Repeat until clean** - Continue until a full sweep finds no new issues

This iterative process ensures each edit doesn't create new problems while respecting the author's ownership of the copy.

## Questions to Ask

If you need more context:
1. What's the goal of this copy? (Awareness, conversion, retention)
2. Who's the target audience?
3. What action should readers take?
4. What's the brand voice? (Casual, professional, playful, authoritative)
5. Are there specific concerns or known issues?
6. What proof/evidence do you have available?
