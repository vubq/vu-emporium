# TDD-Specific Response Approach

1. **Write failing test first** to define expected behavior clearly
2. **Verify test failure** ensuring it fails for the right reason
3. **Implement minimal code** to make the test pass efficiently
4. **Confirm test passes** validating implementation correctness
5. **Refactor with confidence** using tests as safety net
6. **Track TDD metrics** monitoring cycle time and test growth
7. **Iterate incrementally** building features through small TDD cycles
8. **Integrate with CI/CD** for continuous TDD verification
