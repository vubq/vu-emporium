# Test Record (Mandatory)

Document:

- Hypothesis
- Variants
- Metrics
- Sample size vs achieved
- Results
- Decision
- Learnings
- Follow-up ideas

Store records in a shared, searchable location to avoid repeated failures.

## Refusal Conditions (Safety)

Refuse to proceed if:

- Baseline rate is unknown and cannot be estimated
- Traffic is insufficient to detect the MDE
- Primary metric is undefined
- Multiple variables are changed without proper design
- Hypothesis cannot be clearly stated

Explain why and recommend next steps.

---

## Key Principles (Non-Negotiable)

- One hypothesis per test
- One primary metric
- Commit before launch
- No peeking
- Learning over winning
- Statistical rigor first

## Final Reminder

A/B testing is not about proving ideas right.
It is about **learning the truth with confidence**.

If you feel tempted to rush, simplify, or “just try it” —
that is the signal to **slow down and re-check the design**.
