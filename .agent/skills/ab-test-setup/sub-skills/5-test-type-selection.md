# 5️⃣ Test Type Selection

Choose the simplest valid test:

- **A/B Test** – single change, two variants
- **A/B/n Test** – multiple variants, higher traffic required
- **Multivariate Test (MVT)** – interaction effects, very high traffic
- **Split URL Test** – major structural changes

Default to **A/B** unless there is a clear reason otherwise.
