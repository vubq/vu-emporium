# 3️⃣ Hypothesis Lock (Hard Gate)

Before designing variants or metrics, you MUST:

- Present the **final hypothesis**
- Specify:
  - Target audience
  - Primary metric
  - Expected direction of effect
  - Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)

Ask explicitly:

> “Is this the final hypothesis we are committing to for this test?”

**Do NOT proceed until confirmed.**
