# Attack Surface

| Vector | Risk | Question to Ask |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| **Dependencies** | Malicious packages | Do we audit new deps? |
| **Lock files** | Integrity attacks | Are they committed? |
| **Build pipeline** | CI/CD compromise | Who can modify? |
| **Registry** | Typosquatting | Verified sources? |
