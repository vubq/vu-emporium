# Core Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Assume Breach** | Design as if attacker already inside |
| **Zero Trust** | Never trust, always verify |
| **Defense in Depth** | Multiple layers, no single point |
| **Least Privilege** | Minimum required access only |
| **Fail Secure** | On error, deny access |
