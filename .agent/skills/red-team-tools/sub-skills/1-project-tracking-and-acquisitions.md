# 1. Project Tracking and Acquisitions

Set up reconnaissance tracking:

```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir -p target/{recon,vulns,reports}
cd target

# Find acquisitions using Crunchbase
# Search manually for subsidiary companies

# Get ASN for targets
amass intel -org "Target Company" -src

# Alternative ASN lookup
curl -s "https://bgp.he.net/search?search=targetcompany&commit=Search"
```
