# 6. Application Analysis (Jason Haddix Method)

**Heat Map Priority Areas:**

1. **File Uploads** - Test for injection, XXE, SSRF, shell upload
2. **Content Types** - Filter Burp for multipart forms
3. **APIs** - Look for hidden methods, lack of auth
4. **Profile Sections** - Stored XSS, custom fields
5. **Integrations** - SSRF through third parties
6. **Error Pages** - Exotic injection points

**Analysis Questions:**
- How does the app pass data? (Params, API, Hybrid)
- Where does the app talk about users? (UID, UUID endpoints)
- Does the site have multi-tenancy or user levels?
- Does it have a unique threat model?
- How does the site handle XSS/CSRF?
- Has the site had past writeups/exploits?
