# 4. Respond to Comments

Once fixed, respond to the threads as resolved.

```bash
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body "Addressed in latest commit."
```

## Common Mistakes

- **Applying fixes without understanding context**: Always read the surrounding code of a comment.
- **Not verifying auth**: Check `gh auth status` before starting.
