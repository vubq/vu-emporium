#### Direct Reference to Database Objects
Occurs when applications reference database records via user-controllable parameters:
```
# Original URL (authenticated as User A)
example.com/user/profile?id=2023

# Manipulation attempt (accessing User B's data)
example.com/user/profile?id=2022
```

#### Direct Reference to Static Files
Occurs when applications expose file paths or names that can be enumerated:
```
# Original URL (User A's receipt)
example.com/static/receipt/205.pdf

# Manipulation attempt (User B's receipt)
example.com/static/receipt/200.pdf
```
