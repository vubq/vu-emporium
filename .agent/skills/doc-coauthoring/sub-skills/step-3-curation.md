# Step 3: Curation

Ask which points should be kept, removed, or combined. Request brief justifications to help learn priorities for the next sections.

Provide examples:
- "Keep 1,4,7,9"
- "Remove 3 (duplicates 1)"
- "Remove 6 (audience already knows this)"
- "Combine 11 and 12"

**If user gives freeform feedback** (e.g., "looks good" or "I like most of it but...") instead of numbered selections, extract their preferences and proceed. Parse what they want kept/removed/changed and apply it.
