# Step 6: Iterative Refinement

As user provides feedback:
- Use `str_replace` to make edits (never reprint the whole doc)
- **If using artifacts:** Provide link to artifact after each edit
- **If using files:** Just confirm edits are complete
- If user edits doc directly and asks to read it: mentally note the changes they made and keep them in mind for future sections (this shows their preferences)

**Continue iterating** until user is satisfied with the section.
