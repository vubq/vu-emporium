# Exit Condition (Both Approaches)

When Reader Claude consistently answers questions correctly and doesn't surface new gaps or ambiguities, the doc is ready.

## Final Review

When Reader Testing passes:
Announce the doc has passed Reader Claude testing. Before completion:

1. Recommend they do a final read-through themselves - they own this document and are responsible for its quality
2. Suggest double-checking any facts, links, or technical details
3. Ask them to verify it achieves the impact they wanted

Ask if they want one more review, or if the work is done.

**If user wants final review, provide it. Otherwise:**
Announce document completion. Provide a few final tips:
- Consider linking this conversation in an appendix so readers can see how the doc was developed
- Use appendices to provide depth without bloating the main doc
- Update the doc as feedback is received from real readers

## Tips for Effective Guidance

**Tone:**
- Be direct and procedural
- Explain rationale briefly when it affects user behavior
- Don't try to "sell" the approach - just execute it

**Handling Deviations:**
- If user wants to skip a stage: Ask if they want to skip this and write freeform
- If user seems frustrated: Acknowledge this is taking longer than expected. Suggest ways to move faster
- Always give user agency to adjust the process

**Context Management:**
- Throughout, if context is missing on something mentioned, proactively ask
- Don't let gaps accumulate - address them as they come up

**Artifact Management:**
- Use `create_file` for drafting full sections
- Use `str_replace` for all edits
- Provide artifact link after every change
- Never use artifacts for brainstorming lists - that's just conversation

**Quality over Speed:**
- Don't rush through stages
- Each iteration should make meaningful improvements
- The goal is a document that actually works for readers
