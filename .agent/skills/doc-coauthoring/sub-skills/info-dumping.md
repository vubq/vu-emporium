# Info Dumping

Once initial questions are answered, encourage the user to dump all the context they have. Request information such as:
- Background on the project/problem
- Related team discussions or shared documents
- Why alternative solutions aren't being used
- Organizational context (team dynamics, past incidents, politics)
- Timeline pressures or constraints
- Technical architecture or dependencies
- Stakeholder concerns

Advise them not to worry about organizing it - just get it all out. Offer multiple ways to provide context:
- Info dump stream-of-consciousness
- Point to team channels or threads to read
- Link to shared documents

**If integrations are available** (e.g., Slack, Teams, Google Drive, SharePoint, or other MCP servers), mention that these can be used to pull in context directly.

**If no integrations are detected and in Claude.ai or Claude app:** Suggest they can enable connectors in their Claude settings to allow pulling context from messaging apps and document storage directly.

Inform them clarifying questions will be asked once they've done their initial dump.

**During context gathering:**

- If user mentions team channels or shared documents:
  - If integrations available: Inform them the content will be read now, then use the appropriate integration
  - If integrations not available: Explain lack of access. Suggest they enable connectors in Claude settings, or paste the relevant content directly.

- If user mentions entities/projects that are unknown:
  - Ask if connected tools should be searched to learn more
  - Wait for user confirmation before searching

- As user provides context, track what's being learned and what's still unclear

**Asking clarifying questions:**

When user signals they've done their initial dump (or after substantial context provided), ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding:

Generate 5-10 numbered questions based on gaps in the context.

Inform them they can use shorthand to answer (e.g., "1: yes, 2: see #channel, 3: no because backwards compat"), link to more docs, point to channels to read, or just keep info-dumping. Whatever's most efficient for them.

**Exit condition:**
Sufficient context has been gathered when questions show understanding - when edge cases and trade-offs can be asked about without needing basics explained.

**Transition:**
Ask if there's any more context they want to provide at this stage, or if it's time to move on to drafting the document.

If user wants to add more, let them. When ready, proceed to Stage 2.

## Stage 2: Refinement & Structure

**Goal:** Build the document section by section through brainstorming, curation, and iterative refinement.

**Instructions to user:**
Explain that the document will be built section by section. For each section:
1. Clarifying questions will be asked about what to include
2. 5-20 options will be brainstormed
3. User will indicate what to keep/remove/combine
4. The section will be drafted
5. It will be refined through surgical edits

Start with whichever section has the most unknowns (usually the core decision/proposal), then work through the rest.

**Section ordering:**

If the document structure is clear:
Ask which section they'd like to start with.

Suggest starting with whichever section has the most unknowns. For decision docs, that's usually the core proposal. For specs, it's typically the technical approach. Summary sections are best left for last.

If user doesn't know what sections they need:
Based on the type of document and template, suggest 3-5 sections appropriate for the doc type.

Ask if this structure works, or if they want to adjust it.

**Once structure is agreed:**

Create the initial document structure with placeholder text for all sections.

**If access to artifacts is available:**
Use `create_file` to create an artifact. This gives both Claude and the user a scaffold to work from.

Inform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created.

Create artifact with all section headers and brief placeholder text like "[To be written]" or "[Content here]".

Provide the scaffold link and indicate it's time to fill in each section.

**If no access to artifacts:**
Create a markdown file in the working directory. Name it appropriately (e.g., `decision-doc.md`, `technical-spec.md`).

Inform them that the initial structure with placeholders for all sections will be created.

Create file with all section headers and placeholder text.

Confirm the filename has been created and indicate it's time to fill in each section.

**For each section:**
