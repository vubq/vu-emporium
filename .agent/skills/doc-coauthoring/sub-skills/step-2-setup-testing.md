# Step 2: Setup Testing

Provide testing instructions:
1. Open a fresh Claude conversation: https://claude.ai
2. Paste or share the document content (if using a shared doc platform with connectors enabled, provide the link)
3. Ask Reader Claude the generated questions

For each question, instruct Reader Claude to provide:
- The answer
- Whether anything was ambiguous or unclear
- What knowledge/context the doc assumes is already known

Check if Reader Claude gives correct answers or misinterprets anything.
