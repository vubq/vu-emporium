# The Three Pricing Decisions

Every pricing strategy must explicitly answer:

1. **Packaging** – What is included in each tier?
2. **Value Metric** – What customers pay for (users, usage, outcomes)?
3. **Price Level** – How much each tier costs

Failure in any one weakens the system.

## 3. Value-Based Pricing Framework

Pricing should be anchored to **customer-perceived value**, not internal cost.

```
Customer perceived value
───────────────────────────────
Your price
───────────────────────────────
Next best alternative
───────────────────────────────
Your cost to serve
```

**Rules**

* Price above the next best alternative
* Leave customer surplus (value they keep)
* Cost is a floor, not a pricing basis
