# Step 5 — Execution Readiness Check

Before allowing implementation:

Confirm:
- design is approved (single-agent or multi-agent)
- Decision Log is complete
- major assumptions are documented
- known risks are acknowledged

If any condition fails:
- block execution
- return to the appropriate skill

---

## Enforcement Rules

- Do NOT allow implementation without a validated design
- Do NOT allow skipping required review
- Do NOT allow silent escalation or de-escalation
- Do NOT merge design and implementation phases

---

## Exit Conditions

This meta-skill exits ONLY when:
- the next step is explicitly identified, AND
- all required prior steps are complete

Possible exits:
- “Proceed to implementation planning”
- “Run multi-agent-brainstorming”
- “Return to brainstorming for clarification”
- "If a reviewed design reports a final disposition of APPROVED, REVISE, or REJECT, you MUST route the workflow accordingly and state the chosen next step explicitly."

## Design Philosophy

This skill exists to:
- slow down the right decisions
- speed up the right execution
- prevent costly mistakes

Good systems fail early.
Bad systems fail in production.

This meta-skill exists to enforce the former.
