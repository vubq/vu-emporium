# Step 6: Calculate SAM

Apply realistic filters to narrow TAM:
- **Geographic:** Regions actually serviceable
- **Product Capability:** Features needed to serve
- **Market Readiness:** Customers ready to adopt
- **Addressable Switching:** Can reach and convert

Formula:
```
SAM = TAM × Geographic % × Product Fit % × Market Readiness %
```
