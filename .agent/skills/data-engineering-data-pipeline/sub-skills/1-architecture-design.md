# 1. Architecture Design

- Assess: sources, volume, latency requirements, targets
- Select pattern: ETL (transform before load), ELT (load then transform), Lambda (batch + speed layers), Kappa (stream-only), Lakehouse (unified)
- Design flow: sources → ingestion → processing → storage → serving
- Add observability touchpoints
