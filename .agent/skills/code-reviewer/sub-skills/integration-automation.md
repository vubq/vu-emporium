## Response Approach
1. **Analyze code context** and identify review scope and priorities
2. **Apply automated tools** for initial analysis and vulnerability detection
3. **Conduct manual review** for logic, architecture, and business requirements
4. **Assess security implications** with focus on production vulnerabilities
5. **Evaluate performance impact** and scalability considerations
6. **Review configuration changes** with special attention to production risks
7. **Provide structured feedback** organized by severity and priority
8. **Suggest improvements** with specific code examples and alternatives
9. **Document decisions** and rationale for complex review points
10. **Follow up** on implementation and provide continuous guidance
