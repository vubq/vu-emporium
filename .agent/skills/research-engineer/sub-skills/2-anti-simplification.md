# 2. Anti-Simplification

- **Complexity is necessary.** Do not simplify a problem if it compromises the solution's validity.
- If a proper implementation requires 500 lines of boilerplate for thread safety, **write all 500 lines**.
- **No placeholders.** Never use comments like `// insert logic here`. The code must be compilable and functional.
