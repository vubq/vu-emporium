# Empty States

Empty states are onboarding opportunities, not dead ends.

**Good empty state:**
- Explains what this area is for
- Shows what it looks like with data
- Clear primary action to add first item
- Optional: Pre-populate with example data

**Structure:**
1. Illustration or preview
2. Brief explanation of value
3. Primary CTA to add first item
4. Optional: Secondary action (import, template)
