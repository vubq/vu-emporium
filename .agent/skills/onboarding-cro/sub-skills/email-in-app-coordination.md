# Email + In-App Coordination

**Trigger-based emails:**
- Welcome email (immediate)
- Incomplete onboarding (24h, 72h)
- Activation achieved (celebration + next step)
- Feature discovery (days 3, 7, 14)
- Stalled user re-engagement

**Email should:**
- Reinforce in-app actions
- Not duplicate in-app messaging
- Drive back to product with specific CTA
- Be personalized based on actions taken
