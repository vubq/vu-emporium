# Progress Indicators

**Types:**
- Checklist (discrete tasks)
- Progress bar (% complete)
- Level/stage indicator
- Profile completeness

**Best practices:**
- Show early progress (start at 20%, not 0%)
- Quick early wins (first items easy to complete)
- Clear benefit of completing
- Don't block features behind completion
