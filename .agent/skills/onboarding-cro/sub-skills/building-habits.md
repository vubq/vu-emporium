# Building Habits

- What regular action should users take?
- What trigger can prompt return?
- What reward reinforces the behavior?

**Loop structure:**
Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment

**Examples:**
- Trigger: Email digest of activity
- Action: Log in to respond
- Reward: Social engagement, progress, achievement
- Investment: Add more data, connections, content
