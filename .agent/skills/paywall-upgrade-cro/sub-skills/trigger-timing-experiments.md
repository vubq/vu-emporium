# Trigger & Timing Experiments

**When to Show**
- Test trigger timing: after aha moment vs. at feature attempt
- Early trial reminder (7 days) vs. late reminder (1 day before)
- Show after X actions completed vs. after X days
- Test soft prompts at different engagement thresholds
- Trigger based on usage patterns vs. time-based only

**Trigger Type**
- Hard gate (can't proceed) vs. soft gate (preview + prompt)
- Feature lock vs. usage limit as primary trigger
- In-context modal vs. dedicated upgrade page
- Banner reminder vs. modal prompt
- Exit-intent on free plan pages
