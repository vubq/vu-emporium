# Frequency & UX Experiments

**Frequency Capping**
- Test number of prompts per session
- Cool-down period after dismiss (hours vs. days)
- Escalating urgency over time vs. consistent messaging
- Once per feature vs. consolidated prompts
- Re-show rules after major engagement

**Dismiss Behavior**
- "Maybe later" vs. "No thanks" vs. "Remind me tomorrow"
- Ask reason for declining
- Offer alternative (lower tier, annual discount)
- Exit survey on dismiss
- Friendly vs. neutral decline copy

## Questions to Ask

If you need more context:
1. What's your current free → paid conversion rate?
2. What triggers upgrade prompts today?
3. What features are behind the paywall?
4. What's your "aha moment" for users?
5. What pricing model? (per seat, usage, flat)
6. Mobile app, web app, or both?
