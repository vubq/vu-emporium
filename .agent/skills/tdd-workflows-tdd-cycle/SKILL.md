- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

Execute a comprehensive Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow with strict red-green-refactor discipline:

[Extended thinking: This workflow enforces test-first development through coordinated agent orchestration. Each phase of the TDD cycle is strictly enforced with fail-first verification, incremental implementation, and continuous refactoring. The workflow supports both single test and test suite approaches with configurable coverage thresholds.]
