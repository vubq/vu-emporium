# SC2000-2099: Shell Issues

```bash
# SC2009: Consider using pgrep or pidof instead of grep|grep
ps aux | grep -v grep | grep myprocess  # Use pgrep instead

# SC2012: Use `ls` only for viewing. Use `find` for reliable output
for file in $(ls -la)  # Better: use find or globbing

# SC2015: Avoid using && and || instead of if-then-else
[[ -f "$file" ]] && echo "found" || echo "not found"  # Less clear

# SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes
echo '$VAR'  # Literal $VAR, not variable expansion

# SC2026: This word is non-standard. Set POSIXLY_CORRECT
# when using with scripts for other shells
```
