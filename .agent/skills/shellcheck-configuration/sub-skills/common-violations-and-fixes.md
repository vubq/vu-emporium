# Common Violations and Fixes

#### SC2086: Double quote to prevent word splitting

```bash
# Problem
for i in $list; do done

# Solution
for i in $list; do done  # If $list is already quoted, or
for i in "${list[@]}"; do done  # If list is an array
```

#### SC2181: Check exit code directly

```bash
# Problem
some_command
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "success"
fi

# Solution
if some_command; then
    echo "success"
fi
```

#### SC2015: Use if-then instead of && ||

```bash
# Problem
[ -f "$file" ] && echo "exists" || echo "not found"

# Solution - clearer intent
if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "exists"
else
    echo "not found"
fi
```

#### SC2016: Expressions don't expand in single quotes

```bash
# Problem
echo 'Variable value: $VAR'

# Solution
echo "Variable value: $VAR"
```

#### SC2009: Use pgrep instead of grep

```bash
# Problem
ps aux | grep -v grep | grep myprocess

# Solution
pgrep -f myprocess
```
