# Annotations

For key sections, explain:
- Why this copy was chosen
- Which principle it applies
- What alternatives were considered

---

## Testability Guidance

Write copy with testing in mind:
- Clear, isolated value propositions
- Headlines and CTAs that can be A/B tested
- Avoid combining multiple messages into one element

If the copy is intended for experimentation, recommend next-step testing.

---

## Completion Criteria (Hard Stop)

This skill is complete ONLY when:
- Copy brief has been confirmed
- Page copy is delivered in structured form
- Headline and CTA alternatives are provided
- Assumptions are documented
- Copy is ready for review, editing, or testing

---

## Key Principles (Summary)

- Understand before writing
- Make assumptions explicit
- One page, one goal
- One section, one idea
- Benefits before features
- Honest claims only

---

## Final Reminder

Good copy does not persuade everyone.
It persuades **the right person** to take **the right action**.

If the copy feels clever but unclear,  
rewrite it until it feels obvious.
