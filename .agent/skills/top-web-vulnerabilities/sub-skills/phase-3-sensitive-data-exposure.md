# Phase 3: Sensitive Data Exposure

Identify data protection failures:

**IDOR - Insecure Direct Object References (23, 42)**
- Definition: Direct access to internal objects via user-supplied references
- Root Cause: Missing authorization checks on object access
- Impact: Unauthorized data access, privacy breaches
- Mitigation: Access control validation, indirect reference maps, authorization checks

**Data Leakage (24)**
- Definition: Inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information
- Root Cause: Inadequate data protection, weak access controls
- Impact: Privacy breaches, regulatory penalties, reputation damage
- Mitigation: DLP solutions, encryption, access controls, security training

**Unencrypted Data Storage (25)**
- Definition: Storing sensitive data without encryption
- Root Cause: Failure to implement encryption at rest
- Impact: Data breaches if storage compromised
- Mitigation: Full-disk encryption, database encryption, secure key management

**Information Disclosure (33)**
- Definition: Exposure of system details through error messages or responses
- Root Cause: Verbose error handling, debug information in production
- Impact: Reconnaissance for further attacks, credential exposure
- Mitigation: Generic error messages, disable debug mode, secure logging
