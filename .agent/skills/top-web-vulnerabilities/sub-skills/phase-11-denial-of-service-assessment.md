# Phase 11: Denial of Service Assessment

Evaluate availability threats:

**DDoS - Distributed Denial of Service (61)**
- Definition: Overwhelming systems with traffic from multiple sources
- Root Cause: Botnets, amplification attacks
- Impact: Service unavailability, revenue loss
- Mitigation: DDoS protection services, rate limiting, CDN

**Application Layer DoS (62)**
- Definition: Targeting application logic to exhaust resources
- Root Cause: Inefficient code, resource-intensive operations
- Impact: Application unavailability, degraded performance
- Mitigation: Rate limiting, caching, WAF, code optimization

**Resource Exhaustion (63)**
- Definition: Depleting CPU, memory, disk, or network resources
- Root Cause: Inefficient resource management
- Impact: System crashes, service degradation
- Mitigation: Resource quotas, monitoring, load balancing

**Slowloris Attack (64)**
- Definition: Keeping connections open with partial HTTP requests
- Root Cause: No connection timeouts
- Impact: Web server resource exhaustion
- Mitigation: Connection timeouts, request limits, reverse proxy
