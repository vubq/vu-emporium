# Phase 6: Broken Access Control

Assess authorization enforcement:

**Inadequate Authorization (40)**
- Definition: Failure to properly enforce access controls
- Root Cause: Weak authorization policies, missing checks
- Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive resources
- Mitigation: RBAC, centralized IAM, regular access reviews

**Privilege Escalation (41)**
- Definition: Gaining elevated access beyond intended permissions
- Root Cause: Misconfigured permissions, system vulnerabilities
- Impact: Full system compromise, data manipulation
- Mitigation: Least privilege, regular patching, privilege monitoring

**Forceful Browsing (43)**
- Definition: Direct URL manipulation to access restricted resources
- Root Cause: Weak access controls, predictable URLs
- Impact: Unauthorized file/directory access
- Mitigation: Server-side access controls, unpredictable resource paths

**Missing Function-Level Access Control (44)**
- Definition: Unprotected administrative or privileged functions
- Root Cause: Authorization only at UI level
- Impact: Unauthorized function execution
- Mitigation: Server-side authorization for all functions, RBAC
