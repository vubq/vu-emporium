# Phase 10: Client-Side Vulnerabilities

Evaluate browser-side security:

**DOM-based XSS (56)**
- Definition: XSS through client-side JavaScript manipulation
- Root Cause: Unsafe DOM manipulation with user input
- Impact: Session theft, credential harvesting
- Mitigation: Safe DOM APIs, CSP, input sanitization

**Insecure Cross-Origin Communication (57)**
- Definition: Improper handling of cross-origin requests
- Root Cause: Relaxed CORS/SOP policies
- Impact: Data leakage, CSRF attacks
- Mitigation: Strict CORS, CSRF tokens, origin validation

**Browser Cache Poisoning (58)**
- Definition: Manipulation of cached content
- Root Cause: Weak cache validation
- Impact: Malicious content delivery
- Mitigation: Cache-Control headers, HTTPS, integrity checks

**Clickjacking (59, 71)**
- Definition: UI redress attack tricking users into clicking hidden elements
- Root Cause: Missing frame protection
- Impact: Unintended actions, credential theft
- Mitigation: X-Frame-Options, CSP frame-ancestors, frame-busting

**HTML5 Security Issues (60)**
- Definition: Vulnerabilities in HTML5 APIs (WebSockets, Storage, Geolocation)
- Root Cause: Improper API usage, insufficient validation
- Impact: Data leakage, XSS, privacy violations
- Mitigation: Secure API usage, input validation, sandboxing
