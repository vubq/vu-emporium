# Phase 9: Communication Security

Assess transport layer protections:

**Man-in-the-Middle Attack (52)**
- Definition: Interception of communication between parties
- Root Cause: Unencrypted channels, compromised networks
- Impact: Data theft, session hijacking, impersonation
- Mitigation: TLS/SSL, certificate pinning, mutual authentication

**Insufficient Transport Layer Security (53)**
- Definition: Weak or outdated encryption for data in transit
- Root Cause: Outdated protocols (SSLv2/3), weak ciphers
- Impact: Traffic interception, credential theft
- Mitigation: TLS 1.2+, strong cipher suites, HSTS

**Insecure SSL/TLS Configuration (54)**
- Definition: Improperly configured encryption settings
- Root Cause: Weak ciphers, missing forward secrecy
- Impact: Traffic decryption, MITM attacks
- Mitigation: Modern cipher suites, PFS, certificate validation

**Insecure Communication Protocols (55)**
- Definition: Use of unencrypted protocols (HTTP, Telnet, FTP)
- Root Cause: Legacy systems, security unawareness
- Impact: Traffic sniffing, credential exposure
- Mitigation: HTTPS, SSH, SFTP, VPN tunnels
