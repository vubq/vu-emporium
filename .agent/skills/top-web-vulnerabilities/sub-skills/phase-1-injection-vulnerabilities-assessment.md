# Phase 1: Injection Vulnerabilities Assessment

Evaluate injection attack vectors targeting data processing components:

**SQL Injection (1)**
- Definition: Malicious SQL code inserted into input fields to manipulate database queries
- Root Cause: Lack of input validation, improper use of parameterized queries
- Impact: Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, database compromise
- Mitigation: Use parameterized queries/prepared statements, input validation, least privilege database accounts

**Cross-Site Scripting - XSS (2)**
- Definition: Injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users
- Root Cause: Insufficient output encoding, lack of input sanitization
- Impact: Session hijacking, credential theft, website defacement
- Mitigation: Output encoding, Content Security Policy (CSP), input sanitization

**Command Injection (5, 11)**
- Definition: Execution of arbitrary system commands through vulnerable applications
- Root Cause: Unsanitized user input passed to system shells
- Impact: Full system compromise, data exfiltration, lateral movement
- Mitigation: Avoid shell execution, whitelist valid commands, strict input validation

**XML Injection (6), LDAP Injection (7), XPath Injection (8)**
- Definition: Manipulation of XML/LDAP/XPath queries through malicious input
- Root Cause: Improper input handling in query construction
- Impact: Data exposure, authentication bypass, information disclosure
- Mitigation: Input validation, parameterized queries, escape special characters

**Server-Side Template Injection - SSTI (13)**
- Definition: Injection of malicious code into template engines
- Root Cause: User input embedded directly in template expressions
- Impact: Remote code execution, server compromise
- Mitigation: Sandbox template engines, avoid user input in templates, strict input validation
