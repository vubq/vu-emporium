# Phase 8: API Security Assessment

Evaluate API-specific vulnerabilities:

**Insecure API Endpoints (48)**
- Definition: APIs without proper security controls
- Root Cause: Poor API design, missing authentication
- Impact: Data breaches, unauthorized access
- Mitigation: OAuth/JWT, HTTPS, input validation, rate limiting

**API Key Exposure (49)**
- Definition: Leaked or exposed API credentials
- Root Cause: Hardcoded keys, insecure storage
- Impact: Unauthorized API access, abuse
- Mitigation: Secure key storage, rotation, environment variables

**Lack of Rate Limiting (50)**
- Definition: No controls on API request frequency
- Root Cause: Missing throttling mechanisms
- Impact: DoS, API abuse, resource exhaustion
- Mitigation: Rate limits per user/IP, throttling, DDoS protection

**Inadequate Input Validation (51)**
- Definition: APIs accepting unvalidated user input
- Root Cause: Missing server-side validation
- Impact: Injection attacks, data corruption
- Mitigation: Strict validation, parameterized queries, WAF

**API Abuse (75)**
- Definition: Exploiting API functionality for malicious purposes
- Root Cause: Excessive trust in client input
- Impact: Data theft, account takeover, service abuse
- Mitigation: Strong authentication, behavior analysis, anomaly detection
