# Phase 4: Security Misconfiguration

Assess configuration weaknesses:

**Missing Security Headers (26)**
- Definition: Absence of protective HTTP headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS)
- Root Cause: Inadequate server configuration
- Impact: XSS attacks, clickjacking, protocol downgrade
- Mitigation: Implement CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, HSTS

**Default Passwords (28)**
- Definition: Unchanged default credentials on systems/applications
- Root Cause: Failure to change vendor defaults
- Impact: Unauthorized access, system compromise
- Mitigation: Mandatory password changes, strong password policies

**Directory Listing (29)**
- Definition: Web server exposes directory contents
- Root Cause: Improper server configuration
- Impact: Information disclosure, sensitive file exposure
- Mitigation: Disable directory indexing, use default index files

**Unprotected API Endpoints (30)**
- Definition: APIs lacking authentication or authorization
- Root Cause: Missing security controls on API routes
- Impact: Unauthorized data access, API abuse
- Mitigation: OAuth/API keys, access controls, rate limiting

**Open Ports and Services (31)**
- Definition: Unnecessary network services exposed
- Root Cause: Failure to minimize attack surface
- Impact: Exploitation of vulnerable services
- Mitigation: Port scanning audits, firewall rules, service minimization

**Misconfigured CORS (35)**
- Definition: Overly permissive Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies
- Root Cause: Wildcard origins, improper CORS configuration
- Impact: Cross-site request attacks, data theft
- Mitigation: Whitelist trusted origins, validate CORS headers

**Unpatched Software (34)**
- Definition: Systems running outdated vulnerable software
- Root Cause: Neglected patch management
- Impact: Exploitation of known vulnerabilities
- Mitigation: Patch management program, vulnerability scanning, automated updates
