# Middleware, Guards, Interceptors & Pipes

- Common issues: Execution order, context access, async operations
- Root causes: Incorrect implementation, missing async/await, improper error handling
- Solution priority: 1) Fix execution order, 2) Handle async properly, 3) Implement error handling
- Execution order: Middleware → Guards → Interceptors (before) → Pipes → Route handler → Interceptors (after)
