# Request Lifecycle & Middleware

- [ ] Middleware execution order follows: Middleware → Guards → Interceptors → Pipes
- [ ] Guards properly protect routes and return boolean/throw exceptions
- [ ] Interceptors handle async operations correctly
- [ ] Exception filters catch and transform errors appropriately
- [ ] Pipes validate DTOs with class-validator decorators
