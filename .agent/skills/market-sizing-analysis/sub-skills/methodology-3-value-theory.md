# Methodology 3: Value Theory

Calculate based on value created and willingness to pay.

**Process:**
1. Identify problem being solved
2. Quantify current cost of problem (time, money, inefficiency)
3. Calculate value of solution (savings, gains, efficiency)
4. Estimate willingness to pay (typically 10-30% of value)
5. Multiply by addressable customer base

**Formula:**
```
Value per Customer = Problem Cost × % Solved by Solution
Price per Customer = Value × Willingness to Pay % (10-30%)
TAM = Total Potential Customers × Price per Customer
SAM = TAM × % Meeting Buy Criteria
SOM = SAM × Realistic Adoption Rate
```

**When to use:** New categories, disruptive innovations, unclear existing markets

**Strengths:** Shows value creation, works for new markets

**Limitations:** Requires assumptions, harder to validate
