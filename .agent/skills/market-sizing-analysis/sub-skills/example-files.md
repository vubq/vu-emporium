## Quick Start

To perform market sizing analysis:

1. **Define the market** - Problem, customers, category, geography
2. **Choose methodology** - Bottom-up (preferred) or top-down + triangulation
3. **Gather data** - Industry reports, customer data, competitive intelligence
4. **Calculate TAM** - Apply methodology formula
5. **Narrow to SAM** - Apply product, geographic, segment filters
6. **Estimate SOM** - 2-5% realistic capture rate
7. **Validate** - Cross-check with alternative methods
8. **Document** - Show methodology, sources, assumptions
9. **Present** - Structure for audience (investors, strategy, operations)
