# Step 6: Validate and Triangulate

Cross-check using multiple methods.

**Validation Techniques:**
1. Compare top-down and bottom-up results (should be within 30%)
2. Check against public company revenues in space
3. Validate customer count assumptions
4. Sense-check pricing assumptions
5. Review with industry experts
6. Compare to similar market categories

**Red Flags:**
- TAM that's too small (< $1B for VC-backed startups)
- TAM that's too large (unsupported by data)
- SOM that's too aggressive (> 10% in 5 years for new entrant)
- Inconsistency between methodologies (> 50% difference)
