# Step 5: Calculate SOM

Determine realistic obtainable market share.

**Consider:**
- Current market share of competitors
- Typical market share for new entrants (2-5%)
- Resources available (funding, team, time)
- Go-to-market effectiveness
- Competitive advantages
- Time to achieve (3-5 years typically)

**Conservative Approach:**
```
SOM (Year 3) = SAM × 2%
SOM (Year 5) = SAM × 5%
```

**Example:**
- SAM: $720M
- Year 3 SOM: $720M × 2% = $14.4M
- Year 5 SOM: $720M × 5% = $36M
