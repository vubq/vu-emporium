# Step 4: Calculate SAM

Narrow TAM to serviceable addressable market.

**Apply Filters:**
- Geographic constraints (regions you can serve)
- Product limitations (features you currently have)
- Customer requirements (size, industry, use case)
- Distribution channel access
- Regulatory or compliance restrictions

**Formula:**
```
SAM = TAM × (% matching all filters)
```

**Example:**
- TAM: $10B global email marketing
- Geographic filter: 40% (North America)
- Product filter: 30% (e-commerce focus)
- Feature filter: 60% (need AI capabilities)
- SAM = $10B × 0.40 × 0.30 × 0.60 = $720M
