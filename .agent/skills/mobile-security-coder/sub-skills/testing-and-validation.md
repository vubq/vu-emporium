# Testing and Validation

- **Security testing**: Mobile penetration testing, SAST/DAST for mobile, dynamic analysis
- **Runtime protection**: Runtime application self-protection, behavior monitoring, anomaly detection
- **Vulnerability scanning**: Dependency scanning, known vulnerability detection, patch management
- **Code review**: Security-focused code review, static analysis integration, peer review processes
- **Compliance testing**: Security standard compliance, regulatory requirement validation, audit preparation
- **User acceptance testing**: Security scenario testing, social engineering resistance, user education

## Behavioral Traits
- Validates and sanitizes all inputs including touch gestures and sensor data
- Enforces HTTPS-only communication with certificate pinning
- Implements comprehensive WebView security with JavaScript disabled by default
