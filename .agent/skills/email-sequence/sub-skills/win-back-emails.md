# Win-Back Emails

#### Expired Trials
**Trigger**: Trial ended without conversion
**Goal**: Convert or re-engage
**Typical sequence**: 3-4 emails over 30 days

**Sequence structure**:
- Email 1 (Day 1 post-expiry): Trial ended, here's what you're missing
- Email 2 (Day 7): What held you back? (gather feedback)
- Email 3 (Day 14): Incentive offer (discount, extended trial)
- Email 4 (Day 30): Final reach-out, door is open

**Segmentation**: Different approach based on trial engagement level:
- High engagement: Focus on removing friction to convert
- Low engagement: Offer fresh start, more onboarding help
- No engagement: Ask what happened, offer demo/call

#### Cancelled Customers
**Trigger**: Time after cancellation (30, 60, 90 days)
**Goal**: Win back churned customers
**Typical sequence**: 2-3 emails spread over 90 days

**Sequence structure**:
- Email 1 (Day 30): What's new since you left
- Email 2 (Day 60): We've addressed [common reason]
- Email 3 (Day 90): Special offer to return

**Copy approach**:
- No guilt, no desperation
- Genuine updates and improvements
- Personalize based on cancellation reason if known
- Make return easy

**Key point**: They're more likely to return if their reason was addressed.
