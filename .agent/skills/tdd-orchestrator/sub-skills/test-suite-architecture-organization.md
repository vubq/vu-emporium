- Test pyramid optimization and balanced testing strategy implementation
- Comprehensive test categorization (unit, integration, contract, E2E)
- Test suite performance optimization and parallel execution strategies
- Test isolation and independence verification across all test levels
- Shared test utilities and common testing infrastructure management
- Test data management and fixture orchestration across test types
- Cross-cutting concern testing (security, performance, accessibility)
