## 9. Decision Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] **Platform-appropriate procedure?**

- [ ] **Monitoring configured?**
- [ ] **Team notified?**
- [ ] **Time to monitor after?**

## 10. Best Practices

1. **Small, frequent deploys** over big releases
2. **Feature flags** for risky changes
3. **Automate** repetitive steps
4. **Document** every deployment
5. **Review** what went wrong after issues
6. **Test rollback** before you need it

> **Remember:** Every deployment is a risk. Minimize risk through preparation, not speed.
