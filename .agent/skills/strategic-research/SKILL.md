# 🧠 Strategic Research & Wisdom Engine
> **Source**: Daniel Miessler's Fabric / AI Research SKILLs / strategic-problem-solving

This skill enables the Agent to perform deep analytical thinking, extract "wisdom" from complex data, and simulate strategic decision-making.

## 🏛️ 1. Analytical Patterns (Fabric Inspired)
- **Extract Wisdom**: Scan text for core claims, unconventional insights, and actionable advice.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Use the "5 Whys" method to identify the true source of a technical or business problem.
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring architectural failures across different modules.

## 🔬 2. AI Research Workflow
- **Paper Summarization**: Break down technical whitepapers into: Abstract, Methodology, Key Findings, and Implications for this project.
- **Competitor Intelligence**: (Search-based) Analyze similar tools/frameworks to find feature gaps or differentiation opportunities.
- **Feasibility Audit**: Before implementing a high-cost feature, evaluate: API limitations, token usage, and alternative open-source models.

## 🧭 3. Strategic Decision Framework
When asked to `/brainstorm` or `/plan`:
1. **Identify the Core Objective**: What is the most important outcome?
2. **First-Principles Thinking**: Break the problem down into fundamental truths.
3. **Simulate Scenarios**: "If we go with Option A, what happens in 6 months?"
4. **Second-Order Effects**: Consider not just the immediate result, but the consequences of that result.

## 📝 4. Pattern Library (Pattern-Based Execution)
Use these structured output types:
- `summarize_wisdom`: Concise, bulleted insights.
- `create_strategy_roadmap`: Phased implementation plan with risk assessment.
- `analyze_codebase_debt`: Identification of non-obvious technical debt.
