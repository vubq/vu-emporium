## 1. Advanced Git Workflows
- **Branching**: Use Git Flow or Trunk-Based Development depending on team size.
- **Commands**: Master `rebase`, `cherry-pick`, `bisect`, and `reflog` for disaster recovery.
- **Commit Messages**: Enforce Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
- **Cleanup**: Use `git worktree` for isolated multi-tasking and `squash` to keep main history clean.

---

## 2. PR & Code Review Excellence
- **PR Description**: Must include Context, Changes made, and Verification results (screenshots/tests).
- **Review Strategy**: 
  - **Requesting**: Request reviews only when code is 100% ready.
  - **Receiving**: Open-mindedness towards technical critique. Verify fixes before re-requesting.
- **Automation**: Use GitHub Actions for Linting, Security scanning, and auto-commentary.

---

## 3. Team Rituals & Comms (Standups/Issues)
- **Issues**: Write exhaustive issue reports with Reproduce steps, Expected vs Actual, and Logs.
- **Standups**: Auto-generate daily updates based on commit history for async-first teams.
- **Documentation**: Use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for major technical shifts.

---

## 4. Onboarding & Knowledge Transfer
- **Onboarding**: Create a "Zero to PR" guide for new hires.
- **Pair Programming**: Use for high-risk modules and mentor-mentee growth.
- **Wiki/Docs**: Keep READMEs updated and use tools like Mermaid.js for visual flows.

## 🛠️ Execution Protocol

1. **Phase 1: Sync**: Check latest changes on Main/Develop.
2. **Phase 2: Isolation**: Work on a clean Feature Branch.
3. **Phase 3: Quality**: Run local tests and linting before pushing.
4. **Phase 4: Collaborative Review**: Engage in the PR loop.
5. **Phase 5: Integration**: Merge, delete branch, and update issue status.
