# 3. Hypothesis Generation

For each hypothesis include:
- Probability score (0-100%)
- Supporting evidence from logs/traces/code
- Falsification criteria
- Testing approach
- Expected symptoms if true

Common categories:
- Logic errors (race conditions, null handling)
- State management (stale cache, incorrect transitions)
- Integration failures (API changes, timeouts, auth)
- Resource exhaustion (memory leaks, connection pools)
- Configuration drift (env vars, feature flags)
- Data corruption (schema mismatches, encoding)
