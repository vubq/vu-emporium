# 6. Production-Safe Techniques

**Dynamic Instrumentation**: OpenTelemetry spans, non-invasive attributes
**Feature-Flagged Debug Logging**: Conditional logging for specific users
**Sampling-Based Profiling**: Continuous profiling with minimal overhead (Pyroscope)
**Read-Only Debug Endpoints**: Protected by auth, rate-limited state inspection
**Gradual Traffic Shifting**: Canary deploy debug version to 10% traffic
