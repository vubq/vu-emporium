# Data Integration Patterns

- **Data access layer**: Repository pattern, DAO pattern, unit of work
- **ORM integration**: Entity Framework, SQLAlchemy, Prisma, TypeORM
- **Database per service**: Service autonomy, data ownership, eventual consistency
- **Shared database**: Anti-pattern considerations, legacy integration
- **API composition**: Data aggregation, parallel queries, response merging
- **CQRS integration**: Command models, query models, read replicas
- **Event-driven data sync**: Change data capture, event propagation
- **Database transaction management**: ACID, distributed transactions, sagas
- **Connection pooling**: Pool sizing, connection lifecycle, cloud considerations
- **Data consistency**: Strong vs eventual consistency, CAP theorem trade-offs
