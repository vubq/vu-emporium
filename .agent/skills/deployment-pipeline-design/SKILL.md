# Deployment Pipeline Design

Architecture patterns for multi-stage CI/CD pipelines with approval gates and deployment strategies.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to deployment pipeline design
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Purpose

Design robust, secure deployment pipelines that balance speed with safety through proper stage organization and approval workflows.

## Use this skill when

- Design CI/CD architecture
- Implement deployment gates
- Configure multi-environment pipelines
- Establish deployment best practices
- Implement progressive delivery

## Pipeline Stages
