# Phase 4: Monitoring

#### Implement Security Monitoring

- [ ] **Deploy IDS/IPS** - Intrusion detection systems
- [ ] **Enable logging** - Comprehensive audit trails
- [ ] **Configure SIEM** - Centralized log analysis
- [ ] **Set up alerting** - Real-time notifications

**Monitoring Tools:**
```bash
# Check security logs
tail -f /var/log/auth.log
tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log

# Monitor network
tcpdump -i eth0 -w capture.pcap
```

#### Configure Logging

- [ ] **Centralize logs** - Aggregate from all systems
- [ ] **Set retention periods** - Keep logs for analysis
- [ ] **Enable detailed logging** - Application and system level
- [ ] **Test log collection** - Verify all sources working

**Key Logs to Monitor:**
- Authentication events
- Application errors
- Network connections
- File access
- System changes

#### Monitor Exception Tools

- [ ] **Track error rates** - Unusual spikes indicate testing
- [ ] **Brief operations team** - Distinguish testing from attacks
- [ ] **Document baseline** - Normal vs. pentest activity

#### Watch Security Tools

- [ ] **Review IDS alerts** - Separate pentest from real attacks
- [ ] **Monitor WAF logs** - Track blocked attempts
- [ ] **Check endpoint protection** - Antivirus detections
