## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Scope creep | Document and require change approval |
| Testing impacts production | Schedule off-hours, use staging |
| Findings disputed | Provide detailed evidence, retest |
| Remediation delayed | Prioritize by risk, set deadlines |
| Budget exceeded | Define clear scope, fixed-price contracts |
