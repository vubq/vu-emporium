# Phase 2: Environment Preparation

#### Prepare Test Environment

- [ ] **Production vs. staging decision** - Determine where to test
- [ ] **Set testing limits** - No DoS on production
- [ ] **Schedule testing window** - Minimize business impact
- [ ] **Create test accounts** - Provide appropriate access levels

**Environment Options:**
```
Production  - Realistic but risky
Staging     - Safer but may differ from production
Clone       - Ideal but resource-intensive
```

#### Run Preliminary Scans

- [ ] **Execute vulnerability scanners** - Find known issues first
- [ ] **Fix obvious vulnerabilities** - Don't waste pentest time
- [ ] **Document existing issues** - Share with testers

**Common Pre-Scan Tools:**
```bash
# Network vulnerability scan
nmap -sV --script vuln TARGET

# Web vulnerability scan
nikto -h http://TARGET
```

#### Review Security Policy

- [ ] **Verify compliance requirements** - GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA
- [ ] **Document data handling rules** - Sensitive data procedures
- [ ] **Confirm legal authorization** - Get written permission

#### Notify Hosting Provider

- [ ] **Check provider policies** - What testing is allowed?
- [ ] **Submit authorization requests** - AWS, Azure, GCP requirements
- [ ] **Document approvals** - Keep records

**Cloud Provider Policies:**
- AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/
- Azure: https://docs.microsoft.com/security/pentest
- GCP: https://cloud.google.com/security/overview

#### Freeze Developments

- [ ] **Stop deployments during testing** - Maintain consistent environment
- [ ] **Document current versions** - Record system states
- [ ] **Avoid critical patches** - Unless security emergency
