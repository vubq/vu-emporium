# Phase 1: Scope Definition

#### Define Objectives

- [ ] **Clarify testing purpose** - Determine goals (find vulnerabilities, compliance, customer assurance)
- [ ] **Validate pentest necessity** - Ensure penetration test is the right solution
- [ ] **Align outcomes with objectives** - Define success criteria

**Reference Questions:**
- Why are you doing this pentest?
- What specific outcomes do you expect?
- What will you do with the findings?

#### Know Your Test Types

| Type | Purpose | Scope |
|------|---------|-------|
| External Pentest | Assess external attack surface | Public-facing systems |
| Internal Pentest | Assess insider threat risk | Internal network |
| Web Application | Find application vulnerabilities | Specific applications |
| Social Engineering | Test human security | Employees, processes |
| Red Team | Full adversary simulation | Entire organization |

#### Enumerate Likely Threats

- [ ] **Identify high-risk areas** - Where could damage occur?
- [ ] **Assess data sensitivity** - What data could be compromised?
- [ ] **Review legacy systems** - Old systems often have vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Map critical assets** - Prioritize testing targets

#### Define Scope

- [ ] **List in-scope systems** - IPs, domains, applications
- [ ] **Define out-of-scope items** - Systems to avoid
- [ ] **Set testing boundaries** - What techniques are allowed?
- [ ] **Document exclusions** - Third-party systems, production data

#### Budget Planning

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Asset Value | Higher value = higher investment |
| Complexity | More systems = more time |
| Depth Required | Thorough testing costs more |
| Reputation Value | Brand-name firms cost more |

**Budget Reality Check:**
- Cheap pentests often produce poor results
- Align budget with asset criticality
- Consider ongoing vs. one-time testing
