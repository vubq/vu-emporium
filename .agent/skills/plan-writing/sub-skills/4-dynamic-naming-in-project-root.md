# 4. Dynamic Naming in Project Root

- Plan files are saved as `{task-slug}.md` in the PROJECT ROOT
- Name derived from task (e.g., "add auth" → `auth-feature.md`)
- **NEVER** inside `.claude/`, `docs/`, or temp folders

## Planning Principles (NOT Templates!)

> 🔴 **NO fixed templates. Each plan is UNIQUE to the task.**
