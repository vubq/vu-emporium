# Principle 3: Dynamic Content Based on Project Type

**For NEW PROJECT:**
- What tech stack? (decide first)
- What's the MVP? (minimal features)
- What's the file structure?

**For FEATURE ADDITION:**
- Which files are affected?
- What dependencies needed?
- How to verify it works?

**For BUG FIX:**
- What's the root cause?
- What file/line to change?
- How to test the fix?
