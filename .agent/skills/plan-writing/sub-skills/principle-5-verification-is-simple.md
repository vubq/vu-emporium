# Principle 5: Verification is Simple

| ❌ Wrong | ✅ Right |
|----------|----------|
| "Verify the component works correctly" | "Run `npm run dev`, click button, see toast" |
| "Test the API" | "curl localhost:3000/api/users returns 200" |
| "Check styles" | "Open browser, verify dark mode toggle works" |

## Plan Structure (Flexible, Not Fixed!)

```
# [Task Name]

## Goal
One sentence: What are we building/fixing?

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: [Specific action] → Verify: [How to check]
- [ ] Task 2: [Specific action] → Verify: [How to check]
- [ ] Task 3: [Specific action] → Verify: [How to check]

## Done When
- [ ] [Main success criteria]
```

> **That's it.** No phases, no sub-sections unless truly needed.
> Keep it minimal. Add complexity only when required.

## Notes
[Any important considerations]
```

## Best Practices (Quick Reference)

1. **Start with goal** - What are we building/fixing?
2. **Max 10 tasks** - If more, break into multiple plans
3. **Each task verifiable** - Clear "done" criteria
4. **Project-specific** - No copy-paste templates
5. **Update as you go** - Mark `[x]` when complete

## When to Use

- New project from scratch
- Adding a feature
- Fixing a bug (if complex)
- Refactoring multiple files
