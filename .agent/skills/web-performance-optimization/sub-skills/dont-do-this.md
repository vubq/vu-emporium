# ❌ Don't Do This

- **Don't Ignore Mobile** - Test on real mobile devices and slow networks
- **Don't Block Rendering** - Avoid render-blocking CSS and JavaScript
- **Don't Load Everything Upfront** - Lazy load non-critical resources
- **Don't Forget Dimensions** - Always specify image width/height
- **Don't Use Synchronous Scripts** - Use async or defer attributes
