# Phase 4: Fix & Verify

Fix and verify it's truly fixed.

```markdown
## Fix Verification
- [ ] Bug no longer reproduces
- [ ] Related functionality still works
- [ ] No new issues introduced
- [ ] Test added to prevent regression
```

## Debugging Checklist

```markdown
## Before Starting
- [ ] Can reproduce consistently
- [ ] Have minimal reproduction case
- [ ] Understand expected behavior

## During Investigation
- [ ] Check recent changes (git log)
- [ ] Check logs for errors
- [ ] Add logging if needed
- [ ] Use debugger/breakpoints

## After Fix
- [ ] Root cause documented
- [ ] Fix verified
- [ ] Regression test added
- [ ] Similar code checked
```

## Common Debugging Commands

```bash
# Recent changes
git log --oneline -20
git diff HEAD~5

# Search for pattern
grep -r "errorPattern" --include="*.ts"

# Check logs
pm2 logs app-name --err --lines 100
```

## Anti-Patterns

❌ **Random changes** - "Maybe if I change this..."
❌ **Ignoring evidence** - "That can't be the cause"
❌ **Assuming** - "It must be X" without proof
❌ **Not reproducing first** - Fixing blindly
❌ **Stopping at symptoms** - Not finding root cause
