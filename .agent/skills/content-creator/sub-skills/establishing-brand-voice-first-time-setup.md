   - Review brand personality archetypes in `references/brand_guidelines.md`
   - Select primary and secondary archetypes
   - Choose 3-5 tone attributes
   - Document in brand guidelines

3. **Create Voice Sample**
   - Write 3 sample pieces in chosen voice
   - Test consistency using analyzer
   - Refine based on results
