# Phase 5: Credential Stuffing

Test with known breached credentials:

```bash
# Credential stuffing differs from brute force
# Uses known email:password pairs from breaches

# Using Burp Intruder with Pitchfork attack
1. Set username and password as positions
2. Load email list as payload 1
3. Load password list as payload 2 (matched pairs)
4. Analyze for successful logins

# Detection evasion
- Slow request rate
- Rotate source IPs
- Randomize user agents
- Add delays between attempts
```
