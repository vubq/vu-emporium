# Phase 2: Password Policy Testing

Evaluate password requirements and enforcement:

```bash
# Test minimum length (a, ab, abcdefgh)
# Test complexity (password, password1, Password1!)
# Test common weak passwords (123456, password, qwerty, admin)
# Test username as password (admin/admin, test/test)
```

Document policy gaps: Minimum length <8, no complexity, common passwords allowed, username as password.
