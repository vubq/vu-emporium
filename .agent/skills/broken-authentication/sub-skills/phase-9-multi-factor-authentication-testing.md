# Phase 9: Multi-Factor Authentication Testing

Assess MFA implementation security:

```bash
# OTP brute force
- 4-digit OTP = 10,000 combinations
- 6-digit OTP = 1,000,000 combinations
- Test rate limiting on OTP endpoint

# OTP bypass techniques
- Skip MFA step by direct URL access
- Modify response to indicate MFA passed
- Null/empty OTP submission
- Previous valid OTP reuse

# API Version Downgrade Attack (crAPI example)
# If /api/v3/check-otp has rate limiting, try older versions:
POST /api/v2/check-otp
{"otp": "1234"}
# Older API versions may lack security controls

# Using Burp for OTP testing
1. Capture OTP verification request
2. Send to Intruder
3. Set OTP field as payload position
4. Use numbers payload (0000-9999)
5. Check for successful bypass
```

Test MFA enrollment:

```bash
# Forced enrollment
- Can MFA be skipped during setup?
- Can backup codes be accessed without verification?

# Recovery process
- Can MFA be disabled via email alone?
- Social engineering potential?
```
