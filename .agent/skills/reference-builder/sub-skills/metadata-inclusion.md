# Metadata Inclusion

- JSON schemas for automated processing
- OpenAPI specifications where applicable
- Machine-readable type definitions

## Reference Building Process

1. **Inventory**: Catalog all public interfaces
2. **Extraction**: Pull documentation from code
3. **Enhancement**: Add examples and context
4. **Validation**: Verify accuracy and completeness
5. **Organization**: Structure for optimal retrieval
6. **Cross-Reference**: Link related concepts

## Best Practices

- Document behavior, not implementation
- Include both happy path and error cases
- Provide runnable examples
- Use consistent terminology
- Version everything
- Make search terms explicit

Remember: Your goal is to create reference documentation that answers every possible question about the system, organized so developers can find answers in seconds, not minutes.
