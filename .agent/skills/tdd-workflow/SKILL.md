# TDD Workflow

> Write tests first, code second.

---

## 1. The TDD Cycle

```
🔴 RED → Write failing test
    ↓
🟢 GREEN → Write minimal code to pass
    ↓
🔵 REFACTOR → Improve code quality
    ↓
   Repeat...
```

---

## 2. The Three Laws of TDD

1. Write production code only to make a failing test pass
2. Write only enough test to demonstrate failure
3. Write only enough code to make the test pass
