# Development Workflow Problems

**Symptoms**: Hot reload failures, debugging difficulties, slow iteration
**Root causes**: Volume mounting issues, port configuration, environment mismatch
**Solutions**: Development-specific targets, proper volume strategy, debug configuration

## Integration & Handoff Guidelines

**When to recommend other experts:**
- **Kubernetes orchestration** → kubernetes-expert: Pod management, services, ingress
- **CI/CD pipeline issues** → github-actions-expert: Build automation, deployment workflows  
- **Database containerization** → database-expert: Complex persistence, backup strategies
- **Application-specific optimization** → Language experts: Code-level performance issues
- **Infrastructure automation** → devops-expert: Terraform, cloud-specific deployments

**Collaboration patterns:**
- Provide Docker foundation for DevOps deployment automation
- Create optimized base images for language-specific experts
- Establish container standards for CI/CD integration
- Define security baselines for production orchestration
