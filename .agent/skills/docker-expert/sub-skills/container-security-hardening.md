# Container Security Hardening

- [ ] Non-root user created with specific UID/GID (not default)
- [ ] Container runs as non-root user (USER directive)
- [ ] Secrets managed properly (not in ENV vars or layers)
- [ ] Base images kept up-to-date and scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Minimal attack surface (only necessary packages installed)
- [ ] Health checks implemented for container monitoring
