# Dockerfile Optimization & Multi-Stage Builds

- [ ] Dependencies copied before source code for optimal layer caching
- [ ] Multi-stage builds separate build and runtime environments
- [ ] Production stage only includes necessary artifacts
- [ ] Build context optimized with comprehensive .dockerignore
- [ ] Base image selection appropriate (Alpine vs distroless vs scratch)
- [ ] RUN commands consolidated to minimize layers where beneficial
