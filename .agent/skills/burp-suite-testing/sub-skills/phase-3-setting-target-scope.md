# Phase 3: Setting Target Scope

#### Define Scope
Focus testing on specific target:

1. Go to **Target > Site map**
2. Right-click target host in left panel
3. Select **Add to scope**
4. When prompted, click **Yes** to exclude out-of-scope traffic

#### Filter by Scope
Remove noise from HTTP history:

1. Click display filter above HTTP history
2. Select **Show only in-scope items**
3. History now shows only target site traffic

#### Scope Benefits
- Reduces clutter from third-party requests
- Prevents accidental testing of out-of-scope sites
- Improves scanning efficiency
- Creates cleaner reports
