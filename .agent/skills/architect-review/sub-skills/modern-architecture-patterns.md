# Modern Architecture Patterns

- Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture implementation
- Microservices architecture with proper service boundaries
- Event-driven architecture (EDA) with event sourcing and CQRS
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with bounded contexts and ubiquitous language
- Serverless architecture patterns and Function-as-a-Service design
- API-first design with GraphQL, REST, and gRPC best practices
- Layered architecture with proper separation of concerns
