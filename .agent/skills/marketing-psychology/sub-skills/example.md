# Example

**Model:** Paradox of Choice (Pricing Page)

| Factor              | Score |
| ------------------- | ----- |
| Leverage            | 5     |
| Fit                 | 5     |
| Speed               | 4     |
| Ethics              | 5     |
| Implementation Cost | 2     |

```
PLFS = (5 + 5 + 4 + 5) − 2 = 17 (cap at 15)
```

➡️ *Extremely high-leverage, low-risk*
